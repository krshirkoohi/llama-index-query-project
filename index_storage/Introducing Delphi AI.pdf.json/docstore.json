Powered by Ghost\nImpatient? Just try itCyber security is actually pretty hard. It's even harder toget it \"right\".We live in one of the most powerful and enabled generationsof all of history. The birth of the internet era has enabledliterally anyone with a burning enough desire to solveproblems at a scale previously thought impossible.That said building digital products and services isn't acomplete walk in the park, and the internet can be adangerous place if not treated with the respect it needs.The rise of cyber crime has led to market size of $7Trillion by some estimates, larger than some of the worldsbiggest economies.\nWe know that not everyone is a cyber security expert, wealso know that a lot of the terms and language is incrediblynuanced and vague, even confusing the experts themselves.Getting answers to questions such as am I doing this right,what the hell is \"compliance\" and that alert looks scarywhat should I do? is never as easy as we'd like it to be.This is where Delphi comes in.The WhatDelphi builds on top of our work with other AI models,specifically Large Language Models.Delphi itself is a fine-tuned LLM using a custom dataset ofcyber security information, alerts, and reporting that we'vebeen compiling for several years now.We've then built a very simple chat wrapper around theproduced model that you can ask questions to, very similarto how other conversational AIs work, but specificallydesigned to help you get answers and next-step actions forcyber questions or problems you're facing.Today, it's just a simple chat conversation. We started withjust this as we wanted to get a feel and understanding forthe kinds of questions people have about cyber and how theywould ask them.The upcoming future roadmap however, is incredibly featurerich, including;Directly plugging into your current cyber securitytooling to automatically collect, explain, and adviseabout alerts or notificationsAllowing you to upload files or links that you might haveopened but suspect might be malicious, and get instantadvice and feedback about itPasting whole rows of vulnerabilities and having itunderstand and prioritise which ones you should startwith.Sounds good enough? Try it out hereThe HowAs we mentioned earlier, Delphi is an AI model specificallytuned to understand cyber security better, but it doesn'tstop there.Whenever a question is given to Delphi, it first performs alookup of relevant and contextual information that canbetter inform its decision making from both our massive andconstantly evolving dataset of cyber information, and thecontextual understanding of who you are and what you'vepreviously asked it the more you use it.All of this is then fed into a chat completion system thathas been pre-prompted with the relevant context andrequirements. We're continuously evolving what these promptslook like to ensure we're getting the best results possible.Our product thesis for this being that the chat agent needsto both;Perfectly tailor the response to the user that iscurrently asking the questions, be it a cyber securityprofessional, or someones grandmother that hasunknowingly opened a file they shouldn't haveProvides concrete next steps that you can action withconfident authority.That last part is a lot harder. Getting language modals tobe commital about their answers after performing sufficientreasoning about them can be hard, but we're confident in ourapproachIn any case, we're excited to see what people ask Delphi andsee how it continues to evolve as a useful tool for bothprofessionals and not over time.I've heard enough, show me!Building digital products is great, doing it securely isDaniel MilesJul 24, 2023\nSubscribe", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"271400ed-aa24-4f03-8580-4848e98a5b0b": {"doc_hash": "8562255f5bd2bb3d66e34d8d9951ec55b74d22148cddfdb8677c127b56a1a9d3"}}}
