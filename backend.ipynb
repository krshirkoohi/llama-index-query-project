Powered by Ghost\\nDeFiiscompletelyunusableTradFiiscompletelybrokenayyImao\\nThe future of DeFi will look nothing like itcurrently does if it is to ever achieve either itsmission or absolute full potential. The sector has anincredible amount of upside but is finding itselfhampered by a lack of focus, arrogance, anduncertainty.The BackdropDecentralised finance, shortened to simply DeFi, isthe fundamental notion that access to financialservices and security should be a universal right,and that we can leverage decentralised technologiesto be able to realise this idea.Blockchain and crypto technology can be used to bringus products that allow us to swap currencies andother tokens, safely store digital value, trade andexchange this value, and earn a return on that valuethrough various mechanisms, all outside of the majorcentralised institutions and without needing anyexplicit permission to use them.Current StateThe current state of DeFi is frankly, an absolutemess. Plain and simple. The blame here isn’t all forDeFi, the crypto industry in general is in need ofmaturing right across the board.Currently most of the volume and product launches arestill being targeted towards speculators and aliquorice assortment of other bad actors. I’m notsaying speculation is intrinsically bad, but if thisis all this industry amounts to be, then that will beexceptionally disappointing.Crypto in general is suffering heavily — nearmortally — from a user experience problem. The simpleidea of getting a wallet, buying some tokens, tradingthem, paying for something, or other actual usefulapplications of the space, is obtusely challenging,even for tech literate people.Genuine, sector-changing attempts to tackle theseproblems are being hemmed in by ideologues and othermaxi’s who think that “oh but if its not completelyperfectly decentralised or trustless or blah thenit’s clearly bad”. It’s time for them to grow up.I’ll be writing a whole other piece around the“principles vs mass adoption” argument so I won’t getinto it too much here, but at a base level, it’sinsane that I even need to argue it. The time of thegatekeepers is coming to an end.The NeedThe technical capability to drive serious change isalready here. I was part of an elite team last yearthat spent their entire time dedicated to solvingthese problems; and we did. There are plenty of teamsout there that are seriously trying to drive theneedle forwards, but hemmed in by this idea of “thisisn’t where the market is right now” and in somesense thats true, the mistake being that if theythink just servicing the current load of speculatorsis the only market there is, they’re wrong.The future of DeFi will look a lot more like a bank than it willwhatever we have today.If we break down the world of consumer finance, itbecomes pretty clear what the market has decided itwants:Store my money safely and let me spend it where Iwant to, how I want to, and don’t charge me toomuch to do thatLet me save some of this money and maybe generate areturn on that. If you could outperform inflation,that would be awesome.Let me send money to other people easily and safely(not safely comes second, as CashApp demonstrated)If you ever find yourselves in the upper echelons ofthe financial consumer, you might also want:The ability to take loans and other credit productsThe ability to unlock liquidity in certain assets,such as wanting to refinance a house\\nSame EnergyCurrently it is incredibly non-trivial to be able todo these things in DeFi, though thats not to say theprimitives don’t exist. There is infrastructure andproducts out there that if you squint at looks almostexactly like this, but using it is basicallyimpossible;There are lots products around spending cryptoonline, and in-person. These are particularlyrampant in Latin America where the desire to getaway from their native currency systems ispalpable.You don’t have to go very far to find mechanismsfor earning yield in DeFi, even when you strip awaythe ponzi schemes.Sending tokens between two wallets was literallyone of the first use cases for crypto, just doingit isn’t a very enjoyable experience.And with recent innovations we’re able to find;Platforms for unlocking liquidity in assets such asNFTsReal World Asset (RWA) platforms that areattempting to bring things like real-estate on-chain though these are very much still in theirinfancyThat Latin America point is quite poignant. Those ofus that live in The West have this warped view of theworld about what crypto really is and and how itsbeing used, but throughout emerging markets, you’llfind real people who use it day-to-day to exchangemoney for regular household goods because even thishostile experience is worth it to them. They deserveto be serviced better.The VisionThe future of DeFi will, to consumers, look a lotlike modern Neobanks than they do their current form.There will be more than 1 player. They will choose todifferentiate in different ways. This is the sign ofa mature market.They will be “wallet centric” apps similar to Neobankapps but not quite like how they look in either ofthem today. This app will be a gateway and key into ahost of new apps, but you’d never know it; it’ll becleanly abstracted away. This might be because thewallet provider itself, and the bank provider areseparate entities, it might not be. The market willwork out which of these models will work (more onwallet centrism in another post)The app itself will be denominated in actual nativecurrencies. Wallets denominating on ETH isridiculous. ETH is not a currency, SOL isn’t acurrency. USDC is a currency.Users will be able to spend their money usingtraditional rails, and new ones. There will be debitcards that work on traditional rails, and productsthat manage this complexity will have strong moats.We can transfer money to raw addresses, resolvableaddresses such as ENS, or other KYC-ed pieces of datawhere they want to such as phone numbers or emails.This KYC data might be on-chain but private, it mightnot be. Either way the consumer market will requiretrivial mechanisms for the transfer of their moneybetween their friends, and the market will provideit.You’ll be able to recover their accounts. Trust willbe put in entities or mechanisms that are consideredintrinsically safe. For those who choose not to havethis luxury and insist it must be trustless, therewill be mechanisms for them too, though thecomplexity will increase accordingly. This will beokay, but won’t be the norm. The gatekeepers andmaxi’s will shout, they are to be ignored *cough,ledger, cough*A Cambrian explosion of new types of “savingsaccounts” will arrive, powered by the permissionlesson-chain primitives of DeFi, finally unlocking itstrue power. Billions in liquidity will pour intopools, tokenised asset classes, project funds tobankroll initiatives people actually care about withverified returns, and all without needing to huntthem down in a fractured online nebula, an exercisewe know most users simply do not care about.People will be able to see completely how their moneyis being a force for good in the world, the carbonits removing, the charities its helping, the smallbusinesses that are growing. It’ll be tracked andrewarded on-chain, and with it a new host of consumerbenefits will arrive, with brands looking to targettheir specific niche of customer, creating new go-to-market strategies, and consumer choice.Money shall be transacted. Preference shall besignalled not presumed. Experiences shall be tailorednot modelled. The birds shall sing, and the sun shallshine.LandscapeThere is currently a handful of players who are allbarking at this thesis, but there is still such along way to go. A few honourable mentions I’ve beentracking;Ultimate. These started out as a DeFi specificwallet, which naturally falls under that whole“servicing the current speculators” thesis, but arechasing down the Neobank play. It’s an interestingGTM if they can execute it right having alreadycaptured the speculators, now can they service theregular consumer.Meld. These guys went the other way, building out aclear Neobank-on-top-of-wallet play first, and havedone a pretty polished job of it. If they canexecute an effective GTM and product roadmap, couldbe curious to watchPrivy. An execution against “Web3 wallet for allthe users”. They’re shaping up nicely to capturethe mass-adoption wallet market. Should this becoupled with the right DeFi experience; couldeasily be a contender to bring the DeFi revolutionwe deserve.I’m sure there are others, and I’m sure twitter willhave fun pointing them out to me.The InstitutionsInstitutions are not taking this lying down. Almostall of them are exploring what this means to theirbusinesses; I talk to a lot of them. They, however,have more explicit and clear requirements of whatthey want and need out of the space; and what they’dbe prepared to tolerate to get into it, somethingwe’ll save for another post.As the biggest names in traditional finance havedeclared that “tokenisation is the future” so toohave the lines in the sand been drawn; this isn’tgoing away.As TradFi bring their massive portfolios, riskappetites, and debt servicing, partnering it with theefficient, liquid, and open markets that DeFiprovides, we’re destined to enter a new golden age offinancial products for retail consumers not just inthe west, but across the world.Thinking that the sector itself is somehow better offwithout their interest or involvement is just silly.Yes DeFi was in part born out of the notion thattraditional finance has failed us — and in many casesit undoubtably has — but for it to really mature intothe revolution it deserves to be, it’s time to putdown the pitchforks and torches and have sensibleconversations about what that looks like.The regulatory scene is going to change aroundcrypto, in the same way that it will all of finance.This pipe-dream that you can just run around in thecrypto industry with no care or interest for consumerprotection, international law, and basic financialprudence, is exactly that, a pipe dream. If this isyou, grow up.This isn’t to say that DeFi won’t be revolutionarychange, it will. Being borderless and permissionlesswill allow global financial paradigm shift that meanseveryone everywhere can access the financialprimitives they deserve, in a manner that doesn’trequire you to have a masters degree in computerscience to be able to use it not get scammed alongthe way.Closing RemarkIt’s time for this sector to evolve on-the-whole.It’s time for the gatekeepers to be moved aside. Notjust so that we can realise the full potential andvision of DeFi, but so that the innovations we makealong the way can unlock whole new ways of living andstructuring society. The market has clearly signalledhow it is prepared to interact with the digitalworld, it’s time we come and meet them there andservice it.Daniel MilesJun 14, 2023Blog\\nSubscribe', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Wespecifically chose to start this series here and onthis thesis as it represents the fruits of months ofthinking and development. In light of recent reportscoming from the Dutch court – the guilty verdict ofTornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev – it is now,more than ever, pertinent.Background\\xa0Tornado Cash is what we call a “mixer”. A specialtype of privacy-preserving tool that runs onpermissionless, decentralised blockchains. That’s alot of words to the uninitiated, so let’s break themdown.A blockchain is an immutable ledger (read: database)of who sent what tokens to who, and when. Some fancycryptography ensures that this ledger cannot betampered with, and thus is always valid. This is thepower and simplicity of a blockchain. Thisfundamental design means that we can always tracewhere money or on-chain assets originated from, andwho they’re going to, a sort of directed graph thatshows us where money started and every step it tookto get to the other end. A mixer is a simple smartcontract (read: program) that runs on these chainsthat accepts deposits from anyone, and “mixes” it alltogether in a way that makes whoever redeems adeposit impossible to distinguish from the depositorthemselves by breaking the observable link between adeposit and a withdrawal address.It proves – verysimply – a mechanism for creating on-chain privacyfor transactions.Permissionless is a term we use to describe the factthat no-one needs to grant permission or access tothese blockchains or tools. Literally anyone cancreate an account on these chains and start usingboth them, and the smart contracts on them.Decentralised is a term you’ll hear thrown around anever increasing amount, though with each actor usingit differently to suit their needs andinterpretations. We’ll be describing it simply as“neither governed nor controlled by a single definedactor”.So Tornado Cash was, put quite simply, a tool thatanyone could use to preserve the privacy of their on-chain transactions.The Foundations of theWestLike so many of our peers, we are\\xa0 firm believersthat the principles and ideas of Western liberalismare the correct ones.Freedom, your basic rights as an individual to speak,transact, and live without fear of unjustpersecution, arbitrary interference, or subject toinspection by some authoritarian body.We have written previously here about how we believeyour digital identity and your financial one – are inour modern age – one and the same. As the frontiersof technology continue to move forwards, particularlyin the realms of financial payments, settlement, anddigital identities, this truth will only become moreapparent.Since the dawn of democracy, it has been madeabundantly clear that a healthy and functional courtssystem is essential in ensuring these rights areupheld and not abused by those we elect to positionsof authority. As the markets that formed in thesedemocracies evolved, so too did the essential role ofthe regulator to ensure consumer protection and fairplay in the market.It should come as a stark warning then, that one ofthese democracies has gone so far as to pass averdict of guilt for a crime that has not beencommitted, but for one that may be committed in thefuture.\\nOne doesn’t need to be a Dutch legal practitioner torealise the profound misapplication and contortion ofthe law in order to secure a conviction.\\xa0In a case of this nature under English law, in orderto prove conspiracy to commit money laundering, theprosecution must prove that the defendant: (1) agreedto conduct, or to attempt to conduct, a financialtransaction; (2) knew (suspicion is not enough as astate of mind) that the property involved in thetransaction represents the proceeds of crime, and (3)proof of intent to conceal the proceeds.\\xa0\\nNever in the history of liberalism has anyone everbeen found guilty of a crime\\xa0 that could potentiallybe committed by another, third party, at some time inthe future. A truly terrifying precedent to be set bythe court.\\xa0 This conviction grants a governmentunlimited power to prosecute any software developerwho writes code that is later used by a third partyfor nefarious purposes, merely because the developerbecomes aware of that later use. With no limitingprinciple in place, nearly all developers who createopen-source software would be exposed to criminalliability for activity outside of their control yearsor decades later. Put simply, the Dutch court’stheory of liability has the chilling effect ofrejecting core principles of due process and the ruleof law.Building for newPrecedentsWith the precedent now set that you can be imprisonedfor writing and releasing code that could be used bya sanctioned entity, all the builders of the worldshould be taking heed of the warning.Whilst the current target – privacy preservingtooling – may fall outside the scope of what you areworking on, given the gravitas of the ruling, wedon’t expect the contagion to stay there. Anythingfrom DeFi apps to SocialFi that “may” be used bysanctioned entities is now on the table for thecourt, and you should consider yourself at risk.With all that being said, we do believe there issufficient clarity for a robust direction forwards.This essay will outline some of this thinking, thoughit is not to be treated as any official kind ofcounsel, or legal advice. If you do feel in-need ofofficial guidance, please don’t hesitate to reach outto us.The basis of our thinking builds upon a handful ofmain factors;That the regulatory outlines and requirements forcompliance are increasingly clear;In our (widely shared) opinion, the correct way tobuild on-chain is permissionless and immutable;That privacy is an important individual right thatneeds protection; andThat there is clear precedent set for this.Regulatory ClarityAlbeit far from where we’d really like to be in termsof absolute clarity – as expected in maturing marketsectors – we are slowly arriving at clarity on theregulatory and compliance requirements for crypto andvirtual asset providers. For the builders in somejurisdictions, for the better. In others, the worse.The requirements for sanctions and AML screening, therestrictions and controls necessary to be in-place toachieve minimum standards for certain types ofdigital assets, and general diligence necessary to betaken seriously, are broadly speaking becomingdefined. Regardless of your personal ideology andviews of the sector, this is a good thing.The irony of writing these paragraphs given theruling we’re discussing as the centre-point of thisessay is not lost on us; simultaneously the rulingitself sets a degree of clarity. It’s now clear thatany privacy preserving software, on-chain or not, isnow within scope for legal persecution on theEuropean continent. Risk models should be updatedaccordingly.Technical PrecedentIt is true that no smart contract deployed to ablockchain can be modified. Once deployed thecontract itself is immutable. That being said, it isin fact possible to change the behaviour of aprotocol through various technical mechanisms thatare outside the scope of this essay. just take ourword for it (lookup upgradable contracts if you’rereally that interested)It has been an open debate for some time as towhether this approach should be endorsed –particularly for certain types of protocols – as theright way forwards.The benefits are obvious: the ability to upgrade andimprove the behaviour of a protocol with what wouldbe a seamless experience for users. The contracts are“upgraded” (technical implementation notwithstanding)and the users benefit.If smart contracts can be “upgraded” to improve theprotocol, it stands to reason that they can bechanged to enact behaviour to the owners’ own benefitonly – a compromise of the protocol if you will. Theidea that protocols should be immutable on-chain -i.e. being able to be trustedabsolutely such that wecan read the code,in-perpetuity, in the knowledgethey cannot be changed - is compelling. Uniswap as aprotocol is a clear and established demonstration ofthis.The Uniswap PrecedentThere are now 4 versions of the Uniswap protocolavailable. Each one a wholly new deployment of smartcontracts with no association to the previous. Thiswas by design. The contracts could not be “upgraded”to automatically distribute these new features orideas to users. Each user of the protocol – bothsides of the transaction – had to select whichversion(s) of the protocol they wanted to use. Tothis day, there are many newly released tokens thatare distributed on older versions of Uniswap forvarious reasons.What this does mean however is that as time movesforwards, the trust we can place in the contracts toalways behave in that manner, and not have securityrisks increases. Indeed, if there was a critical flawin the protocol that a threat actor could exploit, italmost certainly would have by now.It also provides the creators of Uniswap with a verypowerful defence against the rising tide ofregulation and scrutiny. Uniswap have reasonableneutrality as simply creators of “lower level” partsof the system.It’s that “lower level” aspect that is quitecritical. Even the most technically literate andcrypto-native of readers of this essay have likelynever actually interacted with Uniswap directly atthe protocol level. They’ll have almost certainlyused the Uniswap UI – the officially endorsed productimplementation – to perform whatever action they weretrying to.Layer 8 Problems\\nThe OSI LayersThere is a model we use in computer science calledthe “OSI Model”; a dated, albeit effective tool forunderstanding how our interconnected digital worldworks, each “layer” in the model a different positionin the card stack of abstractions we use to connectsystems, one on top of another until we arrive atwhat you experience as the modern internet.\\nxkdc: DependencyA better view of what this means in practice would bethe above – an evergreen xkcd comic – about thehandful of developers who (thanklessly) continue todevelop and support critical “low level” packages andlibraries we use in our daily lives.There’s that “low level” denomination again.If Alexey is guilty of writing code that“foreseeably” could be used by sanctioned entities,then so are the developers of the encryption,networking, and browser libraries we all – even moreso the government – use daily to protect our digitalactivities; from not just authoritarian inspection,but from the general malice that permeates the world.The courts would never come after developers ofanything lower down in the OSI stack; a model that wefeel that today, does no longer accuratelyencapsulate the evolved complexity and abstractionsthat come with blockchains. In any other“traditional” system, implementing the relevantcontrols and regulations at the top of the stack wasdeemed sufficient. We don’t feel that there is anysubstantial reason for this to change.The design and development of immutable, composableprotocols – financial or otherwise – specificallywhere they are to be used on decentralised,permissionless blockchains, is no different fromdeveloping any other “low level” protocol. Theseprotocols must be immutable for any credible level oftrust to be placed in them, and thus are impossibleto comply with evolving regulatory requirements.Assuming the same set of developers who would likelygo on to build a high-level, user facing applicationthat simply leverages this and potentially otherprotocols, go on to implement any and all pertinentregulatory requirements and controls, there is noreason to believe that these developers had anyintention of sanctions busting or non-compliance.CloseWe should be thankful that there will be a secondcourt case, that for Tornado Cash co-author RomanStorm, held in the US; due instead this time for ajury trial, and not a Dutch three-judge-court. Weshall be keeping a close eye on how that unfolds,what evidence the US prosecutor can actually bring tobear to prove the charges, and how the juryinterprets each position. It is our deep personalhope that sanity prevails, and that the US maintainsits foundational commitment to individual liberties,in a time when\\xa0 its democracy remains again tested.We live in truly unprecedented times; where the ideaof something that isn’t a person can be subject tosanctions, and that a person can be found guilty ofsomething that may or may not happen in the future.We champion and support anyone standing against thealarming rise of illiberalism wherever it can befound, and look forwards to a future where personaland financial freedom for everyone is attainable inany format, private, or otherwise.The Dutch court was of the opinion that it should have been‘foreseeable’ to the software developers when they were writingthe Tornado Cash open source code that, at some unspecified datein the future, money originating from crime could be deposited intothe smart contracts, taking advantage of the concealing effect ofthe tool. It was on this basis of “foreseeability” - that theseimmutable contracts might one day be used by a sanctioned entity\\xa0to launder money - that Alexey was found guilty.\\xa0The court viewed Tornado’s privacy protection function as afunction to conceal - which amounted to conspiracy to moneylaundering under Dutch law. By doing so, the judges assumed therewas no legitimate use case for privacy and treated the developersas responsible for the creation of a tool of potential misuse.\\xa0\\nNone of these elements exist in the case of software developerswho create and deploy immutable smart contract protocols, andnone of them were proven in this case.Daniel MilesJun 13, 2024\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The birth of theinternet era has enabled literally anyone with aburning enough desire to solve problems at a scalepreviously thought impossible.That said building digital products and servicesisn\\'t a complete walk in the park, and the internetcan be a dangerous place if not treated with therespect it needs. The rise of cyber crime has led tomarket size of $7 Trillion by some estimates, largerthan some of the worlds biggest economies.\\nWe know that not everyone is a cyber security expert,we also know that a lot of the terms and language isincredibly nuanced and vague, even confusing theexperts themselves.Getting answers to questions such as am I doing thisright, what the hell is \"compliance\" and that alertlooks scary what should I do? is never as easy aswe\\'d like it to be.This is where Delphi comes in.The WhatDelphi builds on top of our work with other AImodels, specifically Large Language Models.Delphi itself is a fine-tuned LLM using a customdataset of cyber security information, alerts, andreporting that we\\'ve been compiling for several yearsnow.We\\'ve then built a very simple chat wrapper aroundthe produced model that you can ask questions to,very similar to how other conversational AIs work,but specifically designed to help you get answers andnext-step actions for cyber questions or problemsyou\\'re facing.Today, it\\'s just a simple chat conversation. Westarted with just this as we wanted to get a feel andunderstanding for the kinds of questions people haveabout cyber and how they would ask them.The upcoming future roadmap however, is incrediblyfeature rich, including;Directly plugging into your current cyber securitytooling to automatically collect, explain, andadvise about alerts or notificationsAllowing you to upload files or links that youmight have opened but suspect might be malicious,and get instant advice and feedback about itPasting whole rows of vulnerabilities and having itunderstand and prioritise which ones you shouldstart with.Sounds good enough?

Powered by Ghost\\nSTRAININewAlchemy-DeFiTurnsMetalsLiquid\\nFollowing on from our last post on Real World Assets(RWAs), its clear that liquidity is needed to bringmany such projects to fruition. DeFi, with its easeof transaction and confidence in code, is an idealcandidate to bring grand vision of RWAs to life. Thisarticle lays out the bird's eye view of how thismight begin to mechanically work.Stratified CostsMany RWA projects face internally stratified costs.In the case of commodity or precious metals; it canbe more difficult to bring one component part of thesame combined asset to fruition; ground gets hotterand ores get denser the deeper one digs. One canstraightforwardly imagine a way to arbitrage excessdemand into supply of such a component, the same wayany crowdfunder goes to market and says:\\nBut scaling this model, especially under CeFi, haslimited flexibility. Transaction fees are sickening,high value transactions have to be individuallyapproved by law, conversion into more advantageouscurrencies wherever you are is expensive; everythingworks worse, but is entrenched and so is defaultedto. \\xa0Moreover, CeFi, by its declaration and disclosurerequirements, promotes the sorts of perverseincentives which set up oligopolies in exactly thesort of new markets we want to be competitive. How?Well, remember those higher costs? Those are alreadyraising barriers to entry, and, more importantly,promoting strong selection biases for those who canget past them to economise at scale. Combine thiswith the knowledge that you can only get as far asone disclosed jurisdiction plus its connectionsbefore competitors jump on you, and it doesn't makesense to run the completely honest go to market whichthese economic models are fundamentally predicatedon, especially if I've reached the point where Idon't need to do this. Too big to fail, too grandiosefor candour. It instead makes sense to channel yourinner Julius II, and Treaty of Tordesillas yourselfand any competitors into strictly defined zones wherethere's less competition and the consumer ultimatelyloses.DeFi can fix this both for the ambitious producerand, by extension, consumers, even if they nevernotice it. I'd almost go as far as to say theconsumer not needing to focus on their financialsystem is a compliment.Tokens As RightsImagine that some variation of the Green New Deal,mandatory ESG, so on so forth, actually becomes law.I own a Lithium mine, and demand goes stratosphericbecause now all those additional batteries which haveto go in those electric cars need my commodity towork profitably. However, as above, parts of mydeposit previously didn't make sense to exploit, and,even with this newfound sovereign backed demand, somesmaller part still doesn't. We now have three tiersof stratified product going to the same ends. CeFidoesn't allow for easy arbitration on this, nevermind elegant expression of how that cost is going tovary.Now, imagine that I issue a token instead, which,upon certain requirements being met, entitles theholder to the produce, or profit equivalent of, thismine, corresponding to the volume of tokens theyhold. The advantages for me are obvious; I'm notlocked into long term instruments, I can market forliquidity much more widely, and I'm not subject toCeFi mission creep. I can also market all of thesethings as points to investors and consumers alike.On top of that, I can treat the different strata ofmy product with bespoke tokens, or change the releaseorder to simulate that difference, or do any one of ahundred other things. Importantly, I have animmediately flexible way to respond to demand,because demand can now be more directly signalled. Ifthe globe gets hotter than expected and regulationstighten further, I can open up operations into thatthird strata with code in seconds, whereas a paralleloperation in CeFi would involve vis maior clauses inthe innumerable contracts I've signed, which go toany number of arbitrators, so on and so forth. Muchmore costly for everyone involved; far moredistorting on the actual price consumers end uppaying, especially where demand inelastic goods areconcerned.Less obvious, and far more powerful, are theadditional benefits to investors. Like me, theyaren't locked into long term financial contracts.They can trust the code, rather than eleven differentbankers and all their incentives. There's now, justas in any other DeFi space, a market on those tokens.You don't have to care about Lithium to get involvedin my venture now - you can directly speculatestrictly on the financial returns without any CeFirestrictions getting in the way.This then allows all manner of interested andspecialist parties to get involved in their own way;yield farming, options, ETF's; we can directly plughigh fixed costs projects into the liquidity marketsthey need to get prices down and wealth in real termsup. Human deception and error can be eliminatedbecause, code is the law here. Tying back to theabove, the lack of disclosure requirements reduceswhat my competitors know about my capabilities andambitions. It's now decision theory, rather thangeneral game theory. They're forced back intobehaving like exactly that, competitors; I'm forcedinto actually carving out what I want based onproduct quality and customer service, rather thancornering the supply ahead of time and maximising formy own surplus.I can feel Hayek smiling from here.Come One, Come AllAll of the above is true in the case of one commoditywith a specific range of use cases and a variablecost. However, mines aren't pure. Going back to myexample, Magnesium is often found alongside Lithium.Like Lithium, Magnesium has a range of commercial usecases. If its lightweight and electric, or needs tomaintain internal stability at high speed, itprobably has Magnesium in it, but notice that theseuse cases are subtly different from Lithium. Havingenjoyed my runaway success tokenising Lithium, andnoticing the low XED in my products, I want totokenise Magnesium too.And now comes the cherry on top; liquidity pools.DeFi, can, by setting up a pool of tokensrepresenting my Lithium supply compared againsttokens representing my Magnesium supply, do more thaneliminate extortionate CeFi currency arbitrage.\\nThis rests on some assumptions, but not necessarilythe ones you'd intuit. My ownership of the mine atthis stage doesn't matter very much - once the tokensare out in the world for exchange, as long as themine keeps mining, who owns it matters very little.The core assumption is that whatever rate of supplyall this overlay infrastructure was posed on remainsinside tolerance limits. This is, as with every otherfinancial instrument, more true as you rack up risk.The heavier I bet on Lithium against Magnesium, orvice versa, if supply of one stops, I'm in trouble.But there's no reason for this risk to becomeexistential to the given DeFi system; much less sothan in CeFi because, again, code is law. There's noincentive for larger agents to conspire to push theleverage beyond what's sane, knowing that thetaxpayer will backstop them - there's no taxpayerhere.This also allows consortiums of smaller retailinvestors access to profits reserved forinstitutional actors under CeFi. Say a well-performing retail investor gets news of incomingregulation; my Magnesium extraction operation goes sowell that I've flooded some electronics manufacturingmarket somewhere, and the price is going to fallimminently, causing some other tokenised and pooledasset to rise in response (which need not be Lithiumat this point). Well, they can take out a flash loanand arbitrage on the price hike on the othercommodity - easy profit, directly to consumers.C.F. Fiat StablesComparing against fiat stables provides furtherelucidation. Counterparty risk is (largely)ameliorated by using a commmodity - as long as thereis liquid demand for the underlying commodity andconfidence in the token, there'll be someone lookingto purchase. This is not the case where underlyingfiat positions are being abandoned or rolled back.Some others would have been in the worse position offactoring their structural inequalities into theirdistribution, but MiCA more or less kills anypossibility of a competitive European stable.A niche, but perhaps, dare I say, dull market in theunderlying commodity is advisable; those in broaderdemand or with more dangerous applications are likelyto have their movements around the globe regulatedand tracked - all complications project directly ontoany pegged token. This must in turn be reconciledwith logistical constraints and liquidity concerns -the backer can be as confident as they like, but thestable is still limited by the total market of theunderlying commodity. Perhaps some fractionation isin order - it's difficult for me to ship rare earthmetals around the globe on a whim, but if Iincorporate them into a larger order of more commondeliverables, average prices start dropping.Similarly, if my token (and, chemistry allowing,physical currency to match) is based on a rarercommodity to the extent that a price is readilyderivable, I can, up to my established risk appetite,build that into something more commonplace to easeliquidity concerns, and effectively optioniseliquidity.I mention physical coinage representing a token asanother approach to liquidity problems, especiallyones related to friction and uptake. If it becomesjust the next kind of cash, the average person canuse what is also a stable and a token from theirphysical wallet, as well as a chain one. All that isnecessary is drumming up the underlying capital tomatch the token with parallel coinage, and convincingwhichever central banks one intends to target thatintroducing this parallel coinage won't havedisastrous effects. An awful lot certainly, but, avisible amount. This is perhaps the most heterodoxambition in this paper, but in a deglobalising world,I remain hopeful. Those who choose to break from thedollar over pride, prerogative or prudence could finda cooler political alternative in a decentralised,private option, set apart from centralisedgeopolitical intrigue and diorama. Especially injurisdictions where cash substitution is a longrunning issue - none of the political friction ofCBDC's (nor expenses incurred in building thenecessary infrastructure on the public purse), easyintegration into all extant markets, and directtracking, assuming some mechanism to correspond ahybrid coin to its token (the most difficult part tobuild into a technology which would try to solve boththese problems at once, but necessary lest doublespending take hold everywhere). An ATM likedispensary connected to a wallet might be a goodstart.But, drawing our metaphor to a close: if I don't likehow separate my Lithium and Magnesium markets are,even if I can address them separately, and tokenisethose efforts, how about I fuse the two with a tokenmade of 50% Lithium, 50% Magnesium? Ok, don't put itin water, or heated air, or pure oxygen... but youget the point. Liquidity (or reactivity) concerns?Just dilute into a different ratio with a parallelrefining product and resume the process.Especially if favoured counterparties could be madeready, waiting to provide liquidity across thebarrier until it dissolves, and then translatecustomers into the new paradigm once I decide to makerid of it. Instant market-wide efficiencyimprovements, and wider uptake appeal.I'd have triangulated demand between, and therebyprofit maximised the supply of, my individualproducts, derivatives thereof, and fusionstherebetween, in one fell swoop. Oh, yeah, andcreated a parallel financial ecosystem, limited onlyby scale and adoption.Aut Caesar, Aut Nihil.Concluding NecessitiesIt's not obvious where such a system should be basedor begin from. Stables would make a good place tostart, and neither the EU nor US is a good home forthem right now; this will be further commented onlater.Further, as you've likely surmised, it's likely tomake CeFi, and all its institutional power, very,very angry, long before DeFi figures out itsadvertising and comprehensibility problems. In anuncertain, de-globalising world, only relativelyinsulated and uninvested jurisdictions make obvioushomes, and the US isn't a good place to start as longas the SEC maintains its current course. Mexico,Canada and Australia might all be strong candidateswith commodities connections and some kind of shockinsulation from changes in trading markets.However, for the ambitious, I can think of no bettertriple offensive to legitimate DeFi, establish alegacy which spans the transition from CeFi intoDeFi, and which garners prestige to last generations.All remaining notes concern judicious deployment; farbetter handled by operatives than ideates.'Hey, please give me money for x, you'll get y in response [ahead oftime]' even if y is just feeling charitable.\\nIt can directly democratise demand for any comparably pooledasset.George BeglanJun 27, 2023\\nSubscribe\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Thispassage from a soon to be released white-paper weauthored for a client explains;\\nNatural TranslatorsLLMs are exceptionally good at getting from one formof language to another, be it from one interpretationof a text to another, between whole other languages,or where some of the most important advances arebeing made, getting from language that peopleunderstand, to one that machines do.The process of getting from what users want to do insoftware to the machines actually doing it has beenone of the most important and studied fields inmodern software engineering. It drives everythingfrom the foundational APIs and primitives we buildupon, to the user interfaces and design choices thatare made.\\nLLMs in this regard, are the translators we\\'ve alwaysbeen looking for to help get us from the language ofexpressiveness and nuance that we humans use everyday, to the language of rules that is necessary forcomputers to function.There’s no clearer example of this than GithubCopilot, a product designed to support engineers inwriting code — the language of rules that machinesare governed by — from simple human readablecomments.\\nA very simplistic demonstration of Copilot in actionPrompt MachinesThe use of LLMs is not however, just limited totranslation. These models similarly fall under the\"generative AI\" banner for a reason; when given alimited input, prompt, or question, you can leveragethem to generate or complete the content or answerfor you. This enables them to fill interesting rolesin the search and chat functions.There\\'s a common misconception around models such asthese that they\\'re sat atop some massive database ofall known knowledge to answer questions, much in thesame way a normal search engine is. This isn\\'t quiteaccurate (albeit yes the new Bing and Bard productsto leverage AI with their traditional search enginedatabases). These models are trained on massivedatasets that allow them to predict the answer – withincredible accuracy – to your question.Sibylline was named after the Sibylline books,ancient books purchased from a Sibyl by the last kingof Rome, and consulted upon during times of greatcrisis. The word Sibyl is derived from the ancientgreek sibylla or prohpetess; those who would giveanswers towards those who provide good questions.LLMs operate on a similar premise. The responses thatthese models create are formed from not just theinput question that you provide, but also from thesurrounding context, additional input information,and \"prompting\". All of these collectively go in todraw the attention of the model to the next correcttoken, leading to the most accurate answer.\\nOr as Stephen Wolfram succinctly put it...its overall goal is to continue text in a “reasonable” way, based onwhat it’s seen from the training it’s had (which consists in lookingat billions of pages of text from the web, etc.) So at any givenpoint, it’s got a certain amount of text—and its goal is to come upwith an appropriate choice for the next token to add.ClosingThe AI industry is advancing at a rapid pace, withinnovations being unveiled so quickly it seems wemight need our own platform to keep pace—an ideaproposed internally and echoed by our clients.As mentioned, this is the first in a series of postsabout our work and experiments in the AI domain andhow we guide clients in harnessing its potential.Throughout this series, we\\'ll delve into:Our strategy for identifying and validatingeffective AI use-cases and deployments to addressreal client problems, and avoiding hype-driveninvestmentsTechnical breakdowns of how we build and deploycost-effective LLM solutions for our internal toolsand projectsStories from our journeys with clients,highlighting the process of unlocking the power ofAI for their businessesLook forwards to having you follow us for the ride!Natural LanguageNatural language refers to the ways humans communicate usingeither spoken or written words and naturally arises in humansocieties as a means of communication. Most of the languages wespeak on this planet fall under the umbrella of “natural language”.Natural language is both complex and flexible, and allows ushumans to express a wide range of ideas, emotions, and concepts,but it’s also innately ambiguous. It’s this ambiguity that computersstruggle to understand, and where the field of natural languageprocessing comes in. There are no fixed rules in natural language,and even if there were, a significant portion of the speakingpopulation would not follow them; this is the origin of slang andlocal dialects.Natural language processing instead turned to the world ofstatistics to glean insight into language and how to make itmachine usable, with the most recent breakthrough in this fieldcoming in the form of “Large Language Models”Large Language ModelLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a form of artificial intelligencebuilt on top of deep learning architectures, initially such as NeuralNetworks, but more recently leveraging what are called“Transformer” models, an approach initially pioneered by GoogleLLMs were popularised by OpenAI with their release of the ChatGPTproduct; a simple interface for conversing with their latest GPT3.5LLM model. This model surpassed all models at the time at the testsavailable, and captured the imagination of the world as itdemonstrated the real power of LLMs in action, producing someincredible works of writing, code, and insight with what seemed liketrivial effortIn practice, this model was simply the industrial application ofnatural language processing. The contextual meaning of sentencesbeing passed to it, and the expected reply to them, was understoodand created through the intensive statistical analysis of a massivedataset on machine learning models with billions of parameters.Daniel MilesJul 10, 2023\\nSubscribe', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Powered by Ghost\\n“The Wallet” is both correctly regarded andsimultaneously wholly underappreciated as the mostimportant innovation in the Web3 sector. Whilst it istrue that there have been countless innovations inthe space across user experiences and permissionlessDeFi, it is this single core concept that truly holdsthe power to revolutionise how we interact with thedigital world, and it is because of this reason thatwe should be building forwards from this “WalletCentric” view.ForewordFor the majority of 2022, I worked at a Web3 walletstartup that aimed to transform how we interact withWeb3 in its current form. There were clear challengesthat we specifically went after, and hence born themoniker “user experience infrastructure startup”,given everything we did was catered around solvingvery clear UX issues.\\nA wallet that solved the key management problem. Awallet that solved the gas-cost interaction problem.A wallet that solved the ramp problem. Simplyhowever, just a wallet.There are lots of people looking at one or some ofthese challenge and from different angles, but for areally complete experience, we knew that whatever thefinal product was it needed to be seamless; centralto the customer experience, and everywhere.It is from this base position, and conversations I’vehad around it, that I’ve refined my thinking. If youhaven’t already, I thoroughly recommend the “WalletCentric Customer Experience Stack” by Ben Basche.Recent conversations with him have only reinforced myviews here.IdentitiesWhat is a wallet? At a base technical level it can beas simple as a public/private key pair, or as complexas an on-chain smart contract. At a philosophicallevel however?It’s a key to your digital identity. An identity youneed to do anything online.Digital identity is something that we’ve beenexploring for decades now, even long before the firstsmart contracts were written. It’s come in manyshapes and forms; from the humble username andpassword, to the behemoth that is OAuth.Cyber security professionals have wrestled withidentity since cyber was a thing, modelling the bestway to place who someone is, and what they can do,with some models being more successful than others.These models were all incomplete.It turns out that your digital identity and yourfinancial identity are in fact inextricably linked.We have built billions of dollars of products andinfrastructure around this key fact. Paypal, Stripe,Apple Pay; all products that attempt to wrangle these2 separate identities into something a little lesspainful to manage.Consider the customer experience of almost all sitesthese days. You’ll likely login with Google orFacebook, proceed to find the thing that you want, beit a service or a product, and then go to some kindof checkout flow. This checkout flow will allow youto select from one of the integrated paymentssolutions, be it something more seamless such asApple Pay — which has gone to great lengths toattempt to merge these 2 identities — or moretraditionally built solutions such as Stripecheckout. Removing from the equation the heavilyconvoluted settlement layer that is our traditionalfinancial infrastructure, it’s pretty clear thatreally the most desirable experience here is onewhere all of these payment methods come with yourdigital identity;Or that your financial identity was in fact what you used onlineinsteadI’d posit that if “Login with your bank” was anoption because they pioneered OAuth alongside\\xa0Google, it would have been incredibly popular. You’dalready be KYC-ed if that was necessary, paymentswould “just work” and would be secured using the sameteams that keep your money safe in the bank.ExperiencesOutside of revolutionary changes in Human InterfaceDevices such as the newly released Apple Vision Pro,the base experience apps should have is a prettysolved problem.Pull down to refresh. Swipe to go back. Single clicklogin gets you to the start of the value chain.It\\'s been made abundantly clear that the seed-phrasebased approach to wallets thus far is completelyunfit for purpose in that regard. Users don\\'t want tohave to manage their seed phrases, no more than theywant to manage their own email server.The Wallet Centric experience starts here, with acreation and “login\" (read: connect) flow that looksand feels almost identical to the login flows we havetoday, getting users to the key value of your productquickly and with low friction.This isn’t a particularly out-there realisation.Several of the biggest names in the space — Uniswapnotably among them — have decided that the “embeddedwallet” native within their mobile app experience isthe way forwards. These approaches work for getting alarger wedge of market-share by capturing those whochurn due to entry costs; good for their short-termusage numbers, but eliminates key parts of the valueof a true wallet-centric experience.\\nThe contents of my wallet should allow my experienceto be tailored. This can’t be done when itsfragmented across multiple wallets where I would haveto export the private key to move it around.Ramps and RailsHalfway through writing this piece someone sent meSimon Taylors Future of Payments blog; in there beinga particularly pertinent comment;\\nCrypto can act as payment rails, a point Simon alsocalls out, but independently it can act as acustodian. If I want to access DeFi pools with aboveaverage returns or escape my countries currencyvolatility and hedge it by simply holding stables, Iwant to have a combined digital and financialidentity that can allow me to do this.My previous Letter to DeFi talks about how the futureof DeFi will look a lot more like a modern Neobankthan it does what we have today. There I also touchbriefly about how if you were to build one around aWallet Centric experience, you could create somethingseriously compelling, and indeed there are someplayers barking at this thesis.Behind this experience you can then begin to abstractaway the ever increasing number of payment rails thatare being created — and the crypto ramps that want toservice them — reaping the benefits that these teamsare creating in attempting to create smooth fiatrails for customers as you float between the 2systems.A value proposition that can now be brought to allapps; a single contact point for developers to buildfrom and a single identity for users, fiat and cryptobuilt in.As a passing comment I suspect this is Coinbase’s tolose. They have an exceptionally strong position inbeing one of the biggest on-ramps into crypto at themoment — one that’s also attempting to do it properlyno less — and are actively pursuing a “Wallet as aService” strategy. I highly suspect that the naturalevolution of centralised exchanges will converge tobanking which leaves Coinbase; then a bank with adigital wallet identity and deep token liquidity,sitting in an incredibly strong position. I digress,an essay for another time.The LoopThe future of crypto/”web3”/whatever will have usersenter because they arrived at an app they wanted touse, ”logged in” and proceeded to have an identitycreated for them.Where this has been done through a wallet-centricapproach, it’ll be this same identity they have whenthey arrive at the next app they want to use. Thecold-start problem here is ensuring that apps want tobuild from a particular wallet because they solvegenuine user challenges such as rails, gas, or chaincomplexity.The loop arrives when apps want to build out fromthis wallet because they understand that this wherethe users already are.Merchants accept specific payment methods becausethey want to attract and capture the users that arefound within those systems. The future of digitalidentities will have apps building around theidentity instead, knowing that with it comes thefinancial identity with the relevant rails becausethey’re now one and the same.It’s here that once the base experiences have beensolved, that the “identity providers” will begin todifferentiate.Providers can open up more APIs to developers totailor their experiences further, be it from newloyalty offers, to financing options or even cross-chain. Alternatively the experience might be morestraight-jacketed, ensuring that the experienceacross apps is always reproducible and understood,attracting a host of users who churn at too muchchoice and want to simply access a very simple andrefined digital experience. Winners here will, asever, be the ones that can identify what users andbuilders want and iterate to get the right productmarket fit the quickest.Whichever provider masters the “personas” challenge,allowing me to have uniquely tailored experiencesdepending on a certain identity I currently want touse, but without having to “login” to entirely newsystems and break out of flow, stands a strong chanceof creating a very defensible base offering.ClosingOur current digital identities are badly overdue anoverhaul, but simple changes over the “Login” floware insufficient to realise the true potential here.How digital identities should feel is a solvedconsumer problem. No-one but the maxi’s insisted onhaving to manage your own private keys, and theirtime is short lived.How financial identities should behave is a solvedconsumer problem, with minor iterations enabling newexperiences in certain spaces but build onfundamentally the wrong primitives.The convergence of these 2 identities will enable allusers to project themselves digitally in the way thatthey’re supposed to, not missing out on certainexperiences just because they made the wrong consumerchoice of what card issuer they went with.Fundamentally however, we were a wallet startup.\\nI don’t have multiple identities across multiple apps where each apphas created a key-pair for me.I have one identity (perhaps with N personas, more on that later)which I want to project into all of my digital experiences.\\nIndia, the home of UPI and digital identity, doesn\\'t yet have an openbanking standard, which suggests identity is the proper foundationof payments if you were to start again.

Powered by Ghost\\nDeFiiscompletelyunusableTradFiiscompletelybrokenayyImao\\nThe future of DeFi will look nothing like itcurrently does if it is to ever achieve either itsmission or absolute full potential. The sector has anincredible amount of upside but is finding itselfhampered by a lack of focus, arrogance, anduncertainty.The BackdropDecentralised finance, shortened to simply DeFi, isthe fundamental notion that access to financialservices and security should be a universal right,and that we can leverage decentralised technologiesto be able to realise this idea.Blockchain and crypto technology can be used to bringus products that allow us to swap currencies andother tokens, safely store digital value, trade andexchange this value, and earn a return on that valuethrough various mechanisms, all outside of the majorcentralised institutions and without needing anyexplicit permission to use them.Current StateThe current state of DeFi is frankly, an absolutemess. Plain and simple. The blame here isn’t all forDeFi, the crypto industry in general is in need ofmaturing right across the board.Currently most of the volume and product launches arestill being targeted towards speculators and aliquorice assortment of other bad actors. I’m notsaying speculation is intrinsically bad, but if thisis all this industry amounts to be, then that will beexceptionally disappointing.Crypto in general is suffering heavily — nearmortally — from a user experience problem. The simpleidea of getting a wallet, buying some tokens, tradingthem, paying for something, or other actual usefulapplications of the space, is obtusely challenging,even for tech literate people.Genuine, sector-changing attempts to tackle theseproblems are being hemmed in by ideologues and othermaxi’s who think that “oh but if its not completelyperfectly decentralised or trustless or blah thenit’s clearly bad”. It’s time for them to grow up.I’ll be writing a whole other piece around the“principles vs mass adoption” argument so I won’t getinto it too much here, but at a base level, it’sinsane that I even need to argue it. The time of thegatekeepers is coming to an end.The NeedThe technical capability to drive serious change isalready here. I was part of an elite team last yearthat spent their entire time dedicated to solvingthese problems; and we did. There are plenty of teamsout there that are seriously trying to drive theneedle forwards, but hemmed in by this idea of “thisisn’t where the market is right now” and in somesense thats true, the mistake being that if theythink just servicing the current load of speculatorsis the only market there is, they’re wrong.The future of DeFi will look a lot more like a bank than it willwhatever we have today.If we break down the world of consumer finance, itbecomes pretty clear what the market has decided itwants:Store my money safely and let me spend it where Iwant to, how I want to, and don’t charge me toomuch to do thatLet me save some of this money and maybe generate areturn on that. If you could outperform inflation,that would be awesome.Let me send money to other people easily and safely(not safely comes second, as CashApp demonstrated)If you ever find yourselves in the upper echelons ofthe financial consumer, you might also want:The ability to take loans and other credit productsThe ability to unlock liquidity in certain assets,such as wanting to refinance a house\\nSame EnergyCurrently it is incredibly non-trivial to be able todo these things in DeFi, though thats not to say theprimitives don’t exist. There is infrastructure andproducts out there that if you squint at looks almostexactly like this, but using it is basicallyimpossible;There are lots products around spending cryptoonline, and in-person. These are particularlyrampant in Latin America where the desire to getaway from their native currency systems ispalpable.You don’t have to go very far to find mechanismsfor earning yield in DeFi, even when you strip awaythe ponzi schemes.Sending tokens between two wallets was literallyone of the first use cases for crypto, just doingit isn’t a very enjoyable experience.And with recent innovations we’re able to find;Platforms for unlocking liquidity in assets such asNFTsReal World Asset (RWA) platforms that areattempting to bring things like real-estate on-chain though these are very much still in theirinfancyThat Latin America point is quite poignant. Those ofus that live in The West have this warped view of theworld about what crypto really is and and how itsbeing used, but throughout emerging markets, you’llfind real people who use it day-to-day to exchangemoney for regular household goods because even thishostile experience is worth it to them. They deserveto be serviced better.The VisionThe future of DeFi will, to consumers, look a lotlike modern Neobanks than they do their current form.There will be more than 1 player. They will choose todifferentiate in different ways. This is the sign ofa mature market.They will be “wallet centric” apps similar to Neobankapps but not quite like how they look in either ofthem today. This app will be a gateway and key into ahost of new apps, but you’d never know it; it’ll becleanly abstracted away. This might be because thewallet provider itself, and the bank provider areseparate entities, it might not be. The market willwork out which of these models will work (more onwallet centrism in another post)The app itself will be denominated in actual nativecurrencies. Wallets denominating on ETH isridiculous. ETH is not a currency, SOL isn’t acurrency. USDC is a currency.Users will be able to spend their money usingtraditional rails, and new ones. There will be debitcards that work on traditional rails, and productsthat manage this complexity will have strong moats.We can transfer money to raw addresses, resolvableaddresses such as ENS, or other KYC-ed pieces of datawhere they want to such as phone numbers or emails.This KYC data might be on-chain but private, it mightnot be. Either way the consumer market will requiretrivial mechanisms for the transfer of their moneybetween their friends, and the market will provideit.You’ll be able to recover their accounts. Trust willbe put in entities or mechanisms that are consideredintrinsically safe. For those who choose not to havethis luxury and insist it must be trustless, therewill be mechanisms for them too, though thecomplexity will increase accordingly. This will beokay, but won’t be the norm. The gatekeepers andmaxi’s will shout, they are to be ignored *cough,ledger, cough*A Cambrian explosion of new types of “savingsaccounts” will arrive, powered by the permissionlesson-chain primitives of DeFi, finally unlocking itstrue power. Billions in liquidity will pour intopools, tokenised asset classes, project funds tobankroll initiatives people actually care about withverified returns, and all without needing to huntthem down in a fractured online nebula, an exercisewe know most users simply do not care about.People will be able to see completely how their moneyis being a force for good in the world, the carbonits removing, the charities its helping, the smallbusinesses that are growing. It’ll be tracked andrewarded on-chain, and with it a new host of consumerbenefits will arrive, with brands looking to targettheir specific niche of customer, creating new go-to-market strategies, and consumer choice.Money shall be transacted. Preference shall besignalled not presumed. Experiences shall be tailorednot modelled. The birds shall sing, and the sun shallshine.LandscapeThere is currently a handful of players who are allbarking at this thesis, but there is still such along way to go. A few honourable mentions I’ve beentracking;Ultimate. These started out as a DeFi specificwallet, which naturally falls under that whole“servicing the current speculators” thesis, but arechasing down the Neobank play. It’s an interestingGTM if they can execute it right having alreadycaptured the speculators, now can they service theregular consumer.Meld. These guys went the other way, building out aclear Neobank-on-top-of-wallet play first, and havedone a pretty polished job of it. If they canexecute an effective GTM and product roadmap, couldbe curious to watchPrivy. An execution against “Web3 wallet for allthe users”. They’re shaping up nicely to capturethe mass-adoption wallet market. Should this becoupled with the right DeFi experience; couldeasily be a contender to bring the DeFi revolutionwe deserve.I’m sure there are others, and I’m sure twitter willhave fun pointing them out to me.The InstitutionsInstitutions are not taking this lying down. Almostall of them are exploring what this means to theirbusinesses; I talk to a lot of them. They, however,have more explicit and clear requirements of whatthey want and need out of the space; and what they’dbe prepared to tolerate to get into it, somethingwe’ll save for another post.As the biggest names in traditional finance havedeclared that “tokenisation is the future” so toohave the lines in the sand been drawn; this isn’tgoing away.As TradFi bring their massive portfolios, riskappetites, and debt servicing, partnering it with theefficient, liquid, and open markets that DeFiprovides, we’re destined to enter a new golden age offinancial products for retail consumers not just inthe west, but across the world.Thinking that the sector itself is somehow better offwithout their interest or involvement is just silly.Yes DeFi was in part born out of the notion thattraditional finance has failed us — and in many casesit undoubtably has — but for it to really mature intothe revolution it deserves to be, it’s time to putdown the pitchforks and torches and have sensibleconversations about what that looks like.The regulatory scene is going to change aroundcrypto, in the same way that it will all of finance.This pipe-dream that you can just run around in thecrypto industry with no care or interest for consumerprotection, international law, and basic financialprudence, is exactly that, a pipe dream. If this isyou, grow up.This isn’t to say that DeFi won’t be revolutionarychange, it will. Being borderless and permissionlesswill allow global financial paradigm shift that meanseveryone everywhere can access the financialprimitives they deserve, in a manner that doesn’trequire you to have a masters degree in computerscience to be able to use it not get scammed alongthe way.Closing RemarkIt’s time for this sector to evolve on-the-whole.It’s time for the gatekeepers to be moved aside. Notjust so that we can realise the full potential andvision of DeFi, but so that the innovations we makealong the way can unlock whole new ways of living andstructuring society. The market has clearly signalledhow it is prepared to interact with the digitalworld, it’s time we come and meet them there andservice it.Daniel MilesJun 14, 2023Blog\\nSubscribe', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Wespecifically chose to start this series here and onthis thesis as it represents the fruits of months ofthinking and development. In light of recent reportscoming from the Dutch court – the guilty verdict ofTornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev – it is now,more than ever, pertinent.Background\\xa0Tornado Cash is what we call a “mixer”. A specialtype of privacy-preserving tool that runs onpermissionless, decentralised blockchains. That’s alot of words to the uninitiated, so let’s break themdown.A blockchain is an immutable ledger (read: database)of who sent what tokens to who, and when. Some fancycryptography ensures that this ledger cannot betampered with, and thus is always valid. This is thepower and simplicity of a blockchain. Thisfundamental design means that we can always tracewhere money or on-chain assets originated from, andwho they’re going to, a sort of directed graph thatshows us where money started and every step it tookto get to the other end. A mixer is a simple smartcontract (read: program) that runs on these chainsthat accepts deposits from anyone, and “mixes” it alltogether in a way that makes whoever redeems adeposit impossible to distinguish from the depositorthemselves by breaking the observable link between adeposit and a withdrawal address.It proves – verysimply – a mechanism for creating on-chain privacyfor transactions.Permissionless is a term we use to describe the factthat no-one needs to grant permission or access tothese blockchains or tools. Literally anyone cancreate an account on these chains and start usingboth them, and the smart contracts on them.Decentralised is a term you’ll hear thrown around anever increasing amount, though with each actor usingit differently to suit their needs andinterpretations. We’ll be describing it simply as“neither governed nor controlled by a single definedactor”.So Tornado Cash was, put quite simply, a tool thatanyone could use to preserve the privacy of their on-chain transactions.The Foundations of theWestLike so many of our peers, we are\\xa0 firm believersthat the principles and ideas of Western liberalismare the correct ones.Freedom, your basic rights as an individual to speak,transact, and live without fear of unjustpersecution, arbitrary interference, or subject toinspection by some authoritarian body.We have written previously here about how we believeyour digital identity and your financial one – are inour modern age – one and the same. As the frontiersof technology continue to move forwards, particularlyin the realms of financial payments, settlement, anddigital identities, this truth will only become moreapparent.Since the dawn of democracy, it has been madeabundantly clear that a healthy and functional courtssystem is essential in ensuring these rights areupheld and not abused by those we elect to positionsof authority. As the markets that formed in thesedemocracies evolved, so too did the essential role ofthe regulator to ensure consumer protection and fairplay in the market.It should come as a stark warning then, that one ofthese democracies has gone so far as to pass averdict of guilt for a crime that has not beencommitted, but for one that may be committed in thefuture.\\nOne doesn’t need to be a Dutch legal practitioner torealise the profound misapplication and contortion ofthe law in order to secure a conviction.\\xa0In a case of this nature under English law, in orderto prove conspiracy to commit money laundering, theprosecution must prove that the defendant: (1) agreedto conduct, or to attempt to conduct, a financialtransaction; (2) knew (suspicion is not enough as astate of mind) that the property involved in thetransaction represents the proceeds of crime, and (3)proof of intent to conceal the proceeds.\\xa0\\nNever in the history of liberalism has anyone everbeen found guilty of a crime\\xa0 that could potentiallybe committed by another, third party, at some time inthe future. A truly terrifying precedent to be set bythe court.\\xa0 This conviction grants a governmentunlimited power to prosecute any software developerwho writes code that is later used by a third partyfor nefarious purposes, merely because the developerbecomes aware of that later use. With no limitingprinciple in place, nearly all developers who createopen-source software would be exposed to criminalliability for activity outside of their control yearsor decades later. Put simply, the Dutch court’stheory of liability has the chilling effect ofrejecting core principles of due process and the ruleof law.Building for newPrecedentsWith the precedent now set that you can be imprisonedfor writing and releasing code that could be used bya sanctioned entity, all the builders of the worldshould be taking heed of the warning.Whilst the current target – privacy preservingtooling – may fall outside the scope of what you areworking on, given the gravitas of the ruling, wedon’t expect the contagion to stay there. Anythingfrom DeFi apps to SocialFi that “may” be used bysanctioned entities is now on the table for thecourt, and you should consider yourself at risk.With all that being said, we do believe there issufficient clarity for a robust direction forwards.This essay will outline some of this thinking, thoughit is not to be treated as any official kind ofcounsel, or legal advice. If you do feel in-need ofofficial guidance, please don’t hesitate to reach outto us.The basis of our thinking builds upon a handful ofmain factors;That the regulatory outlines and requirements forcompliance are increasingly clear;In our (widely shared) opinion, the correct way tobuild on-chain is permissionless and immutable;That privacy is an important individual right thatneeds protection; andThat there is clear precedent set for this.Regulatory ClarityAlbeit far from where we’d really like to be in termsof absolute clarity – as expected in maturing marketsectors – we are slowly arriving at clarity on theregulatory and compliance requirements for crypto andvirtual asset providers. For the builders in somejurisdictions, for the better. In others, the worse.The requirements for sanctions and AML screening, therestrictions and controls necessary to be in-place toachieve minimum standards for certain types ofdigital assets, and general diligence necessary to betaken seriously, are broadly speaking becomingdefined. Regardless of your personal ideology andviews of the sector, this is a good thing.The irony of writing these paragraphs given theruling we’re discussing as the centre-point of thisessay is not lost on us; simultaneously the rulingitself sets a degree of clarity. It’s now clear thatany privacy preserving software, on-chain or not, isnow within scope for legal persecution on theEuropean continent. Risk models should be updatedaccordingly.Technical PrecedentIt is true that no smart contract deployed to ablockchain can be modified. Once deployed thecontract itself is immutable. That being said, it isin fact possible to change the behaviour of aprotocol through various technical mechanisms thatare outside the scope of this essay. just take ourword for it (lookup upgradable contracts if you’rereally that interested)It has been an open debate for some time as towhether this approach should be endorsed –particularly for certain types of protocols – as theright way forwards.The benefits are obvious: the ability to upgrade andimprove the behaviour of a protocol with what wouldbe a seamless experience for users. The contracts are“upgraded” (technical implementation notwithstanding)and the users benefit.If smart contracts can be “upgraded” to improve theprotocol, it stands to reason that they can bechanged to enact behaviour to the owners’ own benefitonly – a compromise of the protocol if you will. Theidea that protocols should be immutable on-chain -i.e. being able to be trustedabsolutely such that wecan read the code,in-perpetuity, in the knowledgethey cannot be changed - is compelling. Uniswap as aprotocol is a clear and established demonstration ofthis.The Uniswap PrecedentThere are now 4 versions of the Uniswap protocolavailable. Each one a wholly new deployment of smartcontracts with no association to the previous. Thiswas by design. The contracts could not be “upgraded”to automatically distribute these new features orideas to users. Each user of the protocol – bothsides of the transaction – had to select whichversion(s) of the protocol they wanted to use. Tothis day, there are many newly released tokens thatare distributed on older versions of Uniswap forvarious reasons.What this does mean however is that as time movesforwards, the trust we can place in the contracts toalways behave in that manner, and not have securityrisks increases. Indeed, if there was a critical flawin the protocol that a threat actor could exploit, italmost certainly would have by now.It also provides the creators of Uniswap with a verypowerful defence against the rising tide ofregulation and scrutiny. Uniswap have reasonableneutrality as simply creators of “lower level” partsof the system.It’s that “lower level” aspect that is quitecritical. Even the most technically literate andcrypto-native of readers of this essay have likelynever actually interacted with Uniswap directly atthe protocol level. They’ll have almost certainlyused the Uniswap UI – the officially endorsed productimplementation – to perform whatever action they weretrying to.Layer 8 Problems\\nThe OSI LayersThere is a model we use in computer science calledthe “OSI Model”; a dated, albeit effective tool forunderstanding how our interconnected digital worldworks, each “layer” in the model a different positionin the card stack of abstractions we use to connectsystems, one on top of another until we arrive atwhat you experience as the modern internet.\\nxkdc: DependencyA better view of what this means in practice would bethe above – an evergreen xkcd comic – about thehandful of developers who (thanklessly) continue todevelop and support critical “low level” packages andlibraries we use in our daily lives.There’s that “low level” denomination again.If Alexey is guilty of writing code that“foreseeably” could be used by sanctioned entities,then so are the developers of the encryption,networking, and browser libraries we all – even moreso the government – use daily to protect our digitalactivities; from not just authoritarian inspection,but from the general malice that permeates the world.The courts would never come after developers ofanything lower down in the OSI stack; a model that wefeel that today, does no longer accuratelyencapsulate the evolved complexity and abstractionsthat come with blockchains. In any other“traditional” system, implementing the relevantcontrols and regulations at the top of the stack wasdeemed sufficient. We don’t feel that there is anysubstantial reason for this to change.The design and development of immutable, composableprotocols – financial or otherwise – specificallywhere they are to be used on decentralised,permissionless blockchains, is no different fromdeveloping any other “low level” protocol. Theseprotocols must be immutable for any credible level oftrust to be placed in them, and thus are impossibleto comply with evolving regulatory requirements.Assuming the same set of developers who would likelygo on to build a high-level, user facing applicationthat simply leverages this and potentially otherprotocols, go on to implement any and all pertinentregulatory requirements and controls, there is noreason to believe that these developers had anyintention of sanctions busting or non-compliance.CloseWe should be thankful that there will be a secondcourt case, that for Tornado Cash co-author RomanStorm, held in the US; due instead this time for ajury trial, and not a Dutch three-judge-court. Weshall be keeping a close eye on how that unfolds,what evidence the US prosecutor can actually bring tobear to prove the charges, and how the juryinterprets each position. It is our deep personalhope that sanity prevails, and that the US maintainsits foundational commitment to individual liberties,in a time when\\xa0 its democracy remains again tested.We live in truly unprecedented times; where the ideaof something that isn’t a person can be subject tosanctions, and that a person can be found guilty ofsomething that may or may not happen in the future.We champion and support anyone standing against thealarming rise of illiberalism wherever it can befound, and look forwards to a future where personaland financial freedom for everyone is attainable inany format, private, or otherwise.The Dutch court was of the opinion that it should have been‘foreseeable’ to the software developers when they were writingthe Tornado Cash open source code that, at some unspecified datein the future, money originating from crime could be deposited intothe smart contracts, taking advantage of the concealing effect ofthe tool. It was on this basis of “foreseeability” - that theseimmutable contracts might one day be used by a sanctioned entity\\xa0to launder money - that Alexey was found guilty.\\xa0The court viewed Tornado’s privacy protection function as afunction to conceal - which amounted to conspiracy to moneylaundering under Dutch law. By doing so, the judges assumed therewas no legitimate use case for privacy and treated the developersas responsible for the creation of a tool of potential misuse.\\xa0\\nNone of these elements exist in the case of software developerswho create and deploy immutable smart contract protocols, andnone of them were proven in this case.Daniel MilesJun 13, 2024\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Transaction fees are sickening,high value transactions have to be individuallyapproved by law, conversion into more advantageouscurrencies wherever you are is expensive; everythingworks worse, but is entrenched and so is defaultedto. \\xa0Moreover, CeFi, by its declaration and disclosurerequirements, promotes the sorts of perverseincentives which set up oligopolies in exactly thesort of new markets we want to be competitive. How?Well, remember those higher costs? Those are alreadyraising barriers to entry, and, more importantly,promoting strong selection biases for those who canget past them to economise at scale.

However, as above, parts of mydeposit previously didn't make sense to exploit, and,even with this newfound sovereign backed demand, somesmaller part still doesn't. We now have three tiersof stratified product going to the same ends. CeFidoesn't allow for easy arbitration on this, nevermind elegant expression of how that cost is going tovary.Now, imagine that I issue a token instead, which,upon certain requirements being met, entitles theholder to the produce, or profit equivalent of, thismine, corresponding to the volume of tokens theyhold. The advantages for me are obvious; I'm notlocked into long term instruments, I can market forliquidity much more widely, and I'm not subject toCeFi mission creep. I can also market all of thesethings as points to investors and consumers alike.On top of that, I can treat the different strata ofmy product with bespoke tokens, or change the releaseorder to simulate that difference, or do any one of ahundred other things. Importantly, I have animmediately flexible way to respond to demand,because demand can now be more directly signalled. Ifthe globe gets hotter than expected and regulationstighten further, I can open up operations into thatthird strata with code in seconds, whereas a paralleloperation in CeFi would involve vis maior clauses inthe innumerable contracts I've signed, which go toany number of arbitrators, so on and so forth. Muchmore costly for everyone involved; far moredistorting on the actual price consumers end uppaying, especially where demand inelastic goods areconcerned.Less obvious, and far more powerful, are theadditional benefits to investors. Like me, theyaren't locked into long term financial contracts.They can trust the code, rather than eleven differentbankers and all their incentives. There's now, justas in any other DeFi space, a market on those tokens.You don't have to care about Lithium to get involvedin my venture now - you can directly speculatestrictly on the financial returns without any CeFirestrictions getting in the way.This then allows all manner of interested andspecialist parties to get involved in their own way;yield farming, options, ETF's; we can directly plughigh fixed costs projects into the liquidity marketsthey need to get prices down and wealth in real termsup. Human deception and error can be eliminatedbecause, code is the law here. Tying back to theabove, the lack of disclosure requirements reduceswhat my competitors know about my capabilities andambitions. It's now decision theory, rather thangeneral game theory. They're forced back intobehaving like exactly that, competitors; I'm forcedinto actually carving out what I want based onproduct quality and customer service, rather thancornering the supply ahead of time and maximising formy own surplus.I can feel Hayek smiling from here.Come One, Come AllAll of the above is true in the case of one commoditywith a specific range of use cases and a variablecost. However, mines aren't pure. Going back to myexample, Magnesium is often found alongside Lithium.Like Lithium, Magnesium has a range of commercial usecases. If its lightweight and electric, or needs tomaintain internal stability at high speed, itprobably has Magnesium in it, but notice that theseuse cases are subtly different from Lithium. Havingenjoyed my runaway success tokenising Lithium, andnoticing the low XED in my products, I want totokenise Magnesium too.And now comes the cherry on top; liquidity pools.DeFi, can, by setting up a pool of tokensrepresenting my Lithium supply compared againsttokens representing my Magnesium supply, do more thaneliminate extortionate CeFi currency arbitrage.\\nThis rests on some assumptions, but not necessarilythe ones you'd intuit. My ownership of the mine atthis stage doesn't matter very much - once the tokensare out in the world for exchange, as long as themine keeps mining, who owns it matters very little.The core assumption is that whatever rate of supplyall this overlay infrastructure was posed on remainsinside tolerance limits. This is, as with every otherfinancial instrument, more true as you rack up risk.The heavier I bet on Lithium against Magnesium, orvice versa, if supply of one stops, I'm in trouble.But there's no reason for this risk to becomeexistential to the given DeFi system; much less sothan in CeFi because, again, code is law. There's noincentive for larger agents to conspire to push theleverage beyond what's sane, knowing that thetaxpayer will backstop them - there's no taxpayerhere.This also allows consortiums of smaller retailinvestors access to profits reserved forinstitutional actors under CeFi. Say a well-performing retail investor gets news of incomingregulation; my Magnesium extraction operation goes sowell that I've flooded some electronics manufacturingmarket somewhere, and the price is going to fallimminently, causing some other tokenised and pooledasset to rise in response (which need not be Lithiumat this point). Well, they can take out a flash loanand arbitrage on the price hike on the othercommodity - easy profit, directly to consumers.C.F. Fiat StablesComparing against fiat stables provides furtherelucidation. Counterparty risk is (largely)ameliorated by using a commmodity - as long as thereis liquid demand for the underlying commodity andconfidence in the token, there'll be someone lookingto purchase. This is not the case where underlyingfiat positions are being abandoned or rolled back.Some others would have been in the worse position offactoring their structural inequalities into theirdistribution, but MiCA more or less kills anypossibility of a competitive European stable.A niche, but perhaps, dare I say, dull market in theunderlying commodity is advisable; those in broaderdemand or with more dangerous applications are likelyto have their movements around the globe regulatedand tracked - all complications project directly ontoany pegged token. This must in turn be reconciledwith logistical constraints and liquidity concerns -the backer can be as confident as they like, but thestable is still limited by the total market of theunderlying commodity. Perhaps some fractionation isin order - it's difficult for me to ship rare earthmetals around the globe on a whim, but if Iincorporate them into a larger order of more commondeliverables, average prices start dropping.Similarly, if my token (and, chemistry allowing,physical currency to match) is based on a rarercommodity to the extent that a price is readilyderivable, I can, up to my established risk appetite,build that into something more commonplace to easeliquidity concerns, and effectively optioniseliquidity.I mention physical coinage representing a token asanother approach to liquidity problems, especiallyones related to friction and uptake. If it becomesjust the next kind of cash, the average person canuse what is also a stable and a token from theirphysical wallet, as well as a chain one. All that isnecessary is drumming up the underlying capital tomatch the token with parallel coinage, and convincingwhichever central banks one intends to target thatintroducing this parallel coinage won't havedisastrous effects. An awful lot certainly, but, avisible amount. This is perhaps the most heterodoxambition in this paper, but in a deglobalising world,I remain hopeful. Those who choose to break from thedollar over pride, prerogative or prudence could finda cooler political alternative in a decentralised,private option, set apart from centralisedgeopolitical intrigue and diorama. Especially injurisdictions where cash substitution is a longrunning issue - none of the political friction ofCBDC's (nor expenses incurred in building thenecessary infrastructure on the public purse), easyintegration into all extant markets, and directtracking, assuming some mechanism to correspond ahybrid coin to its token (the most difficult part tobuild into a technology which would try to solve boththese problems at once, but necessary lest doublespending take hold everywhere). An ATM likedispensary connected to a wallet might be a goodstart.But, drawing our metaphor to a close: if I don't likehow separate my Lithium and Magnesium markets are,even if I can address them separately, and tokenisethose efforts, how about I fuse the two with a tokenmade of 50% Lithium, 50% Magnesium? Ok, don't put itin water, or heated air, or pure oxygen... but youget the point. Liquidity (or reactivity) concerns?Just dilute into a different ratio with a parallelrefining product and resume the process.Especially if favoured counterparties could be madeready, waiting to provide liquidity across thebarrier until it dissolves, and then translatecustomers into the new paradigm once I decide to makerid of it. Instant market-wide efficiencyimprovements, and wider uptake appeal.I'd have triangulated demand between, and therebyprofit maximised the supply of, my individualproducts, derivatives thereof, and fusionstherebetween, in one fell swoop. Oh, yeah, andcreated a parallel financial ecosystem, limited onlyby scale and adoption.Aut Caesar, Aut Nihil.Concluding NecessitiesIt's not obvious where such a system should be basedor begin from. Stables would make a good place tostart, and neither the EU nor US is a good home forthem right now; this will be further commented onlater.Further, as you've likely surmised, it's likely tomake CeFi, and all its institutional power, very,very angry, long before DeFi figures out itsadvertising and comprehensibility problems. In anuncertain, de-globalising world, only relativelyinsulated and uninvested jurisdictions make obvioushomes, and the US isn't a good place to start as longas the SEC maintains its current course. Mexico,Canada and Australia might all be strong candidateswith commodities connections and some kind of shockinsulation from changes in trading markets.However, for the ambitious, I can think of no bettertriple offensive to legitimate DeFi, establish alegacy which spans the transition from CeFi intoDeFi, and which garners prestige to last generations.All remaining notes concern judicious deployment; farbetter handled by operatives than ideates.'Hey, please give me money for x, you'll get y in response [ahead oftime]' even if y is just feeling charitable.\\nIt can directly democratise demand for any comparably pooledasset.George BeglanJun 27, 2023\\nSubscribe\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Powered by Ghost\\nSibylline has been supporting it’s clients in thedesign and usage of AI models across a multitude ofbusiness verticals and befittingly we wanted to sharehow we think about the emerging trends and patternsin the sector much like our other work.It might seem almost cliché to be jumping on the AIbandwagon like so many others, but our partners havebeen building and shipping AI products back when goodGPT models were in their infancy, and more than ayear before the introduction of the ChatGPT productthat popularised them.IntroductionWhen we talk about the most recent advances in AI,they come across in 2 key main verticals;Diffusion Models - such as DALL-E and Mid JourneyLarge Language Models (LLMs) - Models such as GPT-4and LLAMAWhilst there have been incredible advances in thegenerative AI section, especially across theoreticalsectors such as healthcare and neuroscience, our workis mostly focussed around the use and deployment ofLLMs and natural language, and and is where thisseries will keep its focus.But what exactly are LLMs and natural language? Thispassage from a soon to be released white-paper weauthored for a client explains;\\nNatural TranslatorsLLMs are exceptionally good at getting from one formof language to another, be it from one interpretationof a text to another, between whole other languages,or where some of the most important advances arebeing made, getting from language that peopleunderstand, to one that machines do.The process of getting from what users want to do insoftware to the machines actually doing it has beenone of the most important and studied fields inmodern software engineering. It drives everythingfrom the foundational APIs and primitives we buildupon, to the user interfaces and design choices thatare made.\\nLLMs in this regard, are the translators we\\'ve alwaysbeen looking for to help get us from the language ofexpressiveness and nuance that we humans use everyday, to the language of rules that is necessary forcomputers to function.There’s no clearer example of this than GithubCopilot, a product designed to support engineers inwriting code — the language of rules that machinesare governed by — from simple human readablecomments.\\nA very simplistic demonstration of Copilot in actionPrompt MachinesThe use of LLMs is not however, just limited totranslation. These models similarly fall under the\"generative AI\" banner for a reason; when given alimited input, prompt, or question, you can leveragethem to generate or complete the content or answerfor you. This enables them to fill interesting rolesin the search and chat functions.There\\'s a common misconception around models such asthese that they\\'re sat atop some massive database ofall known knowledge to answer questions, much in thesame way a normal search engine is. This isn\\'t quiteaccurate (albeit yes the new Bing and Bard productsto leverage AI with their traditional search enginedatabases). These models are trained on massivedatasets that allow them to predict the answer – withincredible accuracy – to your question.Sibylline was named after the Sibylline books,ancient books purchased from a Sibyl by the last kingof Rome, and consulted upon during times of greatcrisis. The word Sibyl is derived from the ancientgreek sibylla or prohpetess; those who would giveanswers towards those who provide good questions.LLMs operate on a similar premise. The responses thatthese models create are formed from not just theinput question that you provide, but also from thesurrounding context, additional input information,and \"prompting\". All of these collectively go in todraw the attention of the model to the next correcttoken, leading to the most accurate answer.\\nOr as Stephen Wolfram succinctly put it...its overall goal is to continue text in a “reasonable” way, based onwhat it’s seen from the training it’s had (which consists in lookingat billions of pages of text from the web, etc.) So at any givenpoint, it’s got a certain amount of text—and its goal is to come upwith an appropriate choice for the next token to add.ClosingThe AI industry is advancing at a rapid pace, withinnovations being unveiled so quickly it seems wemight need our own platform to keep pace—an ideaproposed internally and echoed by our clients.As mentioned, this is the first in a series of postsabout our work and experiments in the AI domain andhow we guide clients in harnessing its potential.Throughout this series, we\\'ll delve into:Our strategy for identifying and validatingeffective AI use-cases and deployments to addressreal client problems, and avoiding hype-driveninvestmentsTechnical breakdowns of how we build and deploycost-effective LLM solutions for our internal toolsand projectsStories from our journeys with clients,highlighting the process of unlocking the power ofAI for their businessesLook forwards to having you follow us for the ride!Natural LanguageNatural language refers to the ways humans communicate usingeither spoken or written words and naturally arises in humansocieties as a means of communication. Most of the languages wespeak on this planet fall under the umbrella of “natural language”.Natural language is both complex and flexible, and allows ushumans to express a wide range of ideas, emotions, and concepts,but it’s also innately ambiguous. It’s this ambiguity that computersstruggle to understand, and where the field of natural languageprocessing comes in. There are no fixed rules in natural language,and even if there were, a significant portion of the speakingpopulation would not follow them; this is the origin of slang andlocal dialects.Natural language processing instead turned to the world ofstatistics to glean insight into language and how to make itmachine usable, with the most recent breakthrough in this fieldcoming in the form of “Large Language Models”Large Language ModelLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a form of artificial intelligencebuilt on top of deep learning architectures, initially such as NeuralNetworks, but more recently leveraging what are called“Transformer” models, an approach initially pioneered by GoogleLLMs were popularised by OpenAI with their release of the ChatGPTproduct; a simple interface for conversing with their latest GPT3.5LLM model. This model surpassed all models at the time at the testsavailable, and captured the imagination of the world as itdemonstrated the real power of LLMs in action, producing someincredible works of writing, code, and insight with what seemed liketrivial effortIn practice, this model was simply the industrial application ofnatural language processing. The contextual meaning of sentencesbeing passed to it, and the expected reply to them, was understoodand created through the intensive statistical analysis of a massivedataset on machine learning models with billions of parameters.Daniel MilesJul 10, 2023\\nSubscribe', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Powered by Ghost\\n“The Wallet” is both correctly regarded andsimultaneously wholly underappreciated as the mostimportant innovation in the Web3 sector. Whilst it istrue that there have been countless innovations inthe space across user experiences and permissionlessDeFi, it is this single core concept that truly holdsthe power to revolutionise how we interact with thedigital world, and it is because of this reason thatwe should be building forwards from this “WalletCentric” view.ForewordFor the majority of 2022, I worked at a Web3 walletstartup that aimed to transform how we interact withWeb3 in its current form. There were clear challengesthat we specifically went after, and hence born themoniker “user experience infrastructure startup”,given everything we did was catered around solvingvery clear UX issues.\\nA wallet that solved the key management problem. Awallet that solved the gas-cost interaction problem.A wallet that solved the ramp problem. Simplyhowever, just a wallet.There are lots of people looking at one or some ofthese challenge and from different angles, but for areally complete experience, we knew that whatever thefinal product was it needed to be seamless; centralto the customer experience, and everywhere.It is from this base position, and conversations I’vehad around it, that I’ve refined my thinking. If youhaven’t already, I thoroughly recommend the “WalletCentric Customer Experience Stack” by Ben Basche.Recent conversations with him have only reinforced myviews here.IdentitiesWhat is a wallet? At a base technical level it can beas simple as a public/private key pair, or as complexas an on-chain smart contract. At a philosophicallevel however?It’s a key to your digital identity. An identity youneed to do anything online.Digital identity is something that we’ve beenexploring for decades now, even long before the firstsmart contracts were written. It’s come in manyshapes and forms; from the humble username andpassword, to the behemoth that is OAuth.Cyber security professionals have wrestled withidentity since cyber was a thing, modelling the bestway to place who someone is, and what they can do,with some models being more successful than others.These models were all incomplete.It turns out that your digital identity and yourfinancial identity are in fact inextricably linked.We have built billions of dollars of products andinfrastructure around this key fact. Paypal, Stripe,Apple Pay; all products that attempt to wrangle these2 separate identities into something a little lesspainful to manage.Consider the customer experience of almost all sitesthese days. You’ll likely login with Google orFacebook, proceed to find the thing that you want, beit a service or a product, and then go to some kindof checkout flow. This checkout flow will allow youto select from one of the integrated paymentssolutions, be it something more seamless such asApple Pay — which has gone to great lengths toattempt to merge these 2 identities — or moretraditionally built solutions such as Stripecheckout. Removing from the equation the heavilyconvoluted settlement layer that is our traditionalfinancial infrastructure, it’s pretty clear thatreally the most desirable experience here is onewhere all of these payment methods come with yourdigital identity;Or that your financial identity was in fact what you used onlineinsteadI’d posit that if “Login with your bank” was anoption because they pioneered OAuth alongside\\xa0Google, it would have been incredibly popular. You’dalready be KYC-ed if that was necessary, paymentswould “just work” and would be secured using the sameteams that keep your money safe in the bank.ExperiencesOutside of revolutionary changes in Human InterfaceDevices such as the newly released Apple Vision Pro,the base experience apps should have is a prettysolved problem.Pull down to refresh. Swipe to go back. Single clicklogin gets you to the start of the value chain.It\\'s been made abundantly clear that the seed-phrasebased approach to wallets thus far is completelyunfit for purpose in that regard. Users don\\'t want tohave to manage their seed phrases, no more than theywant to manage their own email server.The Wallet Centric experience starts here, with acreation and “login\" (read: connect) flow that looksand feels almost identical to the login flows we havetoday, getting users to the key value of your productquickly and with low friction.This isn’t a particularly out-there realisation.Several of the biggest names in the space — Uniswapnotably among them — have decided that the “embeddedwallet” native within their mobile app experience isthe way forwards. These approaches work for getting alarger wedge of market-share by capturing those whochurn due to entry costs; good for their short-termusage numbers, but eliminates key parts of the valueof a true wallet-centric experience.\\nThe contents of my wallet should allow my experienceto be tailored. This can’t be done when itsfragmented across multiple wallets where I would haveto export the private key to move it around.Ramps and RailsHalfway through writing this piece someone sent meSimon Taylors Future of Payments blog; in there beinga particularly pertinent comment;\\nCrypto can act as payment rails, a point Simon alsocalls out, but independently it can act as acustodian. If I want to access DeFi pools with aboveaverage returns or escape my countries currencyvolatility and hedge it by simply holding stables, Iwant to have a combined digital and financialidentity that can allow me to do this.My previous Letter to DeFi talks about how the futureof DeFi will look a lot more like a modern Neobankthan it does what we have today. There I also touchbriefly about how if you were to build one around aWallet Centric experience, you could create somethingseriously compelling, and indeed there are someplayers barking at this thesis.Behind this experience you can then begin to abstractaway the ever increasing number of payment rails thatare being created — and the crypto ramps that want toservice them — reaping the benefits that these teamsare creating in attempting to create smooth fiatrails for customers as you float between the 2systems.A value proposition that can now be brought to allapps; a single contact point for developers to buildfrom and a single identity for users, fiat and cryptobuilt in.As a passing comment I suspect this is Coinbase’s tolose. They have an exceptionally strong position inbeing one of the biggest on-ramps into crypto at themoment — one that’s also attempting to do it properlyno less — and are actively pursuing a “Wallet as aService” strategy. I highly suspect that the naturalevolution of centralised exchanges will converge tobanking which leaves Coinbase; then a bank with adigital wallet identity and deep token liquidity,sitting in an incredibly strong position. I digress,an essay for another time.The LoopThe future of crypto/”web3”/whatever will have usersenter because they arrived at an app they wanted touse, ”logged in” and proceeded to have an identitycreated for them.Where this has been done through a wallet-centricapproach, it’ll be this same identity they have whenthey arrive at the next app they want to use. Thecold-start problem here is ensuring that apps want tobuild from a particular wallet because they solvegenuine user challenges such as rails, gas, or chaincomplexity.The loop arrives when apps want to build out fromthis wallet because they understand that this wherethe users already are.Merchants accept specific payment methods becausethey want to attract and capture the users that arefound within those systems. The future of digitalidentities will have apps building around theidentity instead, knowing that with it comes thefinancial identity with the relevant rails becausethey’re now one and the same.It’s here that once the base experiences have beensolved, that the “identity providers” will begin todifferentiate.Providers can open up more APIs to developers totailor their experiences further, be it from newloyalty offers, to financing options or even cross-chain. Alternatively the experience might be morestraight-jacketed, ensuring that the experienceacross apps is always reproducible and understood,attracting a host of users who churn at too muchchoice and want to simply access a very simple andrefined digital experience. Winners here will, asever, be the ones that can identify what users andbuilders want and iterate to get the right productmarket fit the quickest.Whichever provider masters the “personas” challenge,allowing me to have uniquely tailored experiencesdepending on a certain identity I currently want touse, but without having to “login” to entirely newsystems and break out of flow, stands a strong chanceof creating a very defensible base offering.ClosingOur current digital identities are badly overdue anoverhaul, but simple changes over the “Login” floware insufficient to realise the true potential here.How digital identities should feel is a solvedconsumer problem. No-one but the maxi’s insisted onhaving to manage your own private keys, and theirtime is short lived.How financial identities should behave is a solvedconsumer problem, with minor iterations enabling newexperiences in certain spaces but build onfundamentally the wrong primitives.The convergence of these 2 identities will enable allusers to project themselves digitally in the way thatthey’re supposed to, not missing out on certainexperiences just because they made the wrong consumerchoice of what card issuer they went with.Fundamentally however, we were a wallet startup.\\nI don’t have multiple identities across multiple apps where each apphas created a key-pair for me.I have one identity (perhaps with N personas, more on that later)which I want to project into all of my digital experiences.\\nIndia, the home of UPI and digital identity, doesn\\'t yet have an openbanking standard, which suggests identity is the proper foundationof payments if you were to start again.

Powered by Ghost DeFiiscompletelyunusableTradFiiscompletelybrokenayyImao The future of DeFi will look nothing like itcurrently does if it is to ever achieve either itsmission or absolute full potential. The sector has anincredible amount of upside but is finding itselfhampered by a lack of focus, arrogance, anduncertainty.The BackdropDecentralised finance, shortened to simply DeFi, isthe fundamental notion that access to financialservices and security should be a universal right,and that we can leverage decentralised technologiesto be able to realise this idea.Blockchain and crypto technology can be used to bringus products that allow us to swap currencies andother tokens, safely store digital value, trade andexchange this value, and earn a return on that valuethrough various mechanisms, all outside of the majorcentralised institutions and without needing anyexplicit permission to use them.Current StateThe current state of DeFi is frankly, an absolutemess. Plain and simple. The blame here isn’t all forDeFi, the crypto industry in general is in need ofmaturing right across the board.Currently most of the volume and product launches arestill being targeted towards speculators and aliquorice assortment of other bad actors. I’m notsaying speculation is intrinsically bad, but if thisis all this industry amounts to be, then that will beexceptionally disappointing.Crypto in general is suffering heavily — nearmortally — from a user experience problem. The simpleidea of getting a wallet, buying some tokens, tradingthem, paying for something, or other actual usefulapplications of the space, is obtusely challenging,even for tech literate people.Genuine, sector-changing attempts to tackle theseproblems are being hemmed in by ideologues and othermaxi’s who think that “oh but if its not completelyperfectly decentralised or trustless or blah thenit’s clearly bad”. It’s time for them to grow up.I’ll be writing a whole other piece around the“principles vs mass adoption” argument so I won’t getinto it too much here, but at a base level, it’sinsane that I even need to argue it. The time of thegatekeepers is coming to an end.The NeedThe technical capability to drive serious change isalready here. I was part of an elite team last yearthat spent their entire time dedicated to solvingthese problems; and we did. There are plenty of teamsout there that are seriously trying to drive theneedle forwards, but hemmed in by this idea of “thisisn’t where the market is right now” and in somesense thats true, the mistake being that if theythink just servicing the current load of speculatorsis the only market there is, they’re wrong.The future of DeFi will look a lot more like a bank than it willwhatever we have today.If we break down the world of consumer finance, itbecomes pretty clear what the market has decided itwants:Store my money safely and let me spend it where Iwant to, how I want to, and don’t charge me toomuch to do thatLet me save some of this money and maybe generate areturn on that. If you could outperform inflation,that would be awesome.Let me send money to other people easily and safely(not safely comes second, as CashApp demonstrated)If you ever find yourselves in the upper echelons ofthe financial consumer, you might also want:The ability to take loans and other credit productsThe ability to unlock liquidity in certain assets,such as wanting to refinance a house Same EnergyCurrently it is incredibly non-trivial to be able todo these things in DeFi, though thats not to say theprimitives don’t exist. There is infrastructure andproducts out there that if you squint at looks almostexactly like this, but using it is basicallyimpossible;There are lots products around spending cryptoonline, and in-person. These are particularlyrampant in Latin America where the desire to getaway from their native currency systems ispalpable.You don’t have to go very far to find mechanismsfor earning yield in DeFi, even when you strip awaythe ponzi schemes.Sending tokens between two wallets was literallyone of the first use cases for crypto, just doingit isn’t a very enjoyable experience.And with recent innovations we’re able to find;Platforms for unlocking liquidity in assets such asNFTsReal World Asset (RWA) platforms that areattempting to bring things like real-estate on-chain though these are very much still in theirinfancyThat Latin America point is quite poignant. Those ofus that live in The West have this warped view of theworld about what crypto really is and and how itsbeing used, but throughout emerging markets, you’llfind real people who use it day-to-day to exchangemoney for regular household goods because even thishostile experience is worth it to them. They deserveto be serviced better.The VisionThe future of DeFi will, to consumers, look a lotlike modern Neobanks than they do their current form.There will be more than 1 player. They will choose todifferentiate in different ways. This is the sign ofa mature market.They will be “wallet centric” apps similar to Neobankapps but not quite like how they look in either ofthem today. This app will be a gateway and key into ahost of new apps, but you’d never know it; it’ll becleanly abstracted away. This might be because thewallet provider itself, and the bank provider areseparate entities, it might not be. The market willwork out which of these models will work (more onwallet centrism in another post)The app itself will be denominated in actual nativecurrencies. Wallets denominating on ETH isridiculous. ETH is not a currency, SOL isn’t acurrency. USDC is a currency.Users will be able to spend their money usingtraditional rails, and new ones. There will be debitcards that work on traditional rails, and productsthat manage this complexity will have strong moats.We can transfer money to raw addresses, resolvableaddresses such as ENS, or other KYC-ed pieces of datawhere they want to such as phone numbers or emails.This KYC data might be on-chain but private, it mightnot be. Either way the consumer market will requiretrivial mechanisms for the transfer of their moneybetween their friends, and the market will provideit.You’ll be able to recover their accounts. Trust willbe put in entities or mechanisms that are consideredintrinsically safe. For those who choose not to havethis luxury and insist it must be trustless, therewill be mechanisms for them too, though thecomplexity will increase accordingly. This will beokay, but won’t be the norm. The gatekeepers andmaxi’s will shout, they are to be ignored *cough,ledger, cough*A Cambrian explosion of new types of “savingsaccounts” will arrive, powered by the permissionlesson-chain primitives of DeFi, finally unlocking itstrue power. Billions in liquidity will pour intopools, tokenised asset classes, project funds tobankroll initiatives people actually care about withverified returns, and all without needing to huntthem down in a fractured online nebula, an exercisewe know most users simply do not care about.People will be able to see completely how their moneyis being a force for good in the world, the carbonits removing, the charities its helping, the smallbusinesses that are growing. It’ll be tracked andrewarded on-chain, and with it a new host of consumerbenefits will arrive, with brands looking to targettheir specific niche of customer, creating new go-to-market strategies, and consumer choice.Money shall be transacted. Preference shall besignalled not presumed. Experiences shall be tailorednot modelled. The birds shall sing, and the sun shallshine.LandscapeThere is currently a handful of players who are allbarking at this thesis, but there is still such along way to go. A few honourable mentions I’ve beentracking;Ultimate. These started out as a DeFi specificwallet, which naturally falls under that whole“servicing the current speculators” thesis, but arechasing down the Neobank play. It’s an interestingGTM if they can execute it right having alreadycaptured the speculators, now can they service theregular consumer.Meld. These guys went the other way, building out aclear Neobank-on-top-of-wallet play first, and havedone a pretty polished job of it. If they canexecute an effective GTM and product roadmap, couldbe curious to watchPrivy. An execution against “Web3 wallet for allthe users”. They’re shaping up nicely to capturethe mass-adoption wallet market. Should this becoupled with the right DeFi experience; couldeasily be a contender to bring the DeFi revolutionwe deserve.I’m sure there are others, and I’m sure twitter willhave fun pointing them out to me.The InstitutionsInstitutions are not taking this lying down. Almostall of them are exploring what this means to theirbusinesses; I talk to a lot of them. They, however,have more explicit and clear requirements of whatthey want and need out of the space; and what they’dbe prepared to tolerate to get into it, somethingwe’ll save for another post.As the biggest names in traditional finance havedeclared that “tokenisation is the future” so toohave the lines in the sand been drawn; this isn’tgoing away.As TradFi bring their massive portfolios, riskappetites, and debt servicing, partnering it with theefficient, liquid, and open markets that DeFiprovides, we’re destined to enter a new golden age offinancial products for retail consumers not just inthe west, but across the world.Thinking that the sector itself is somehow better offwithout their interest or involvement is just silly.Yes DeFi was in part born out of the notion thattraditional finance has failed us — and in many casesit undoubtably has — but for it to really mature intothe revolution it deserves to be, it’s time to putdown the pitchforks and torches and have sensibleconversations about what that looks like.The regulatory scene is going to change aroundcrypto, in the same way that it will all of finance.This pipe-dream that you can just run around in thecrypto industry with no care or interest for consumerprotection, international law, and basic financialprudence, is exactly that, a pipe dream. If this isyou, grow up.This isn’t to say that DeFi won’t be revolutionarychange, it will. Being borderless and permissionlesswill allow global financial paradigm shift that meanseveryone everywhere can access the financialprimitives they deserve, in a manner that doesn’trequire you to have a masters degree in computerscience to be able to use it not get scammed alongthe way.Closing RemarkIt’s time for this sector to evolve on-the-whole.It’s time for the gatekeepers to be moved aside. Notjust so that we can realise the full potential andvision of DeFi, but so that the innovations we makealong the way can unlock whole new ways of living andstructuring society. The market has clearly signalledhow it is prepared to interact with the digitalworld, it’s time we come and meet them there andservice it.Daniel MilesJun 14, 2023Blog Subscribe', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Wespecifically chose to start this series here and onthis thesis as it represents the fruits of months ofthinking and development. In light of recent reportscoming from the Dutch court – the guilty verdict ofTornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev – it is now,more than ever, pertinent.Background Tornado Cash is what we call a “mixer”. A specialtype of privacy-preserving tool that runs onpermissionless, decentralised blockchains. That’s alot of words to the uninitiated, so let’s break themdown.A blockchain is an immutable ledger (read: database)of who sent what tokens to who, and when. Some fancycryptography ensures that this ledger cannot betampered with, and thus is always valid. This is thepower and simplicity of a blockchain. Thisfundamental design means that we can always tracewhere money or on-chain assets originated from, andwho they’re going to, a sort of directed graph thatshows us where money started and every step it tookto get to the other end. A mixer is a simple smartcontract (read: program) that runs on these chainsthat accepts deposits from anyone, and “mixes” it alltogether in a way that makes whoever redeems adeposit impossible to distinguish from the depositorthemselves by breaking the observable link between adeposit and a withdrawal address.It proves – verysimply – a mechanism for creating on-chain privacyfor transactions.Permissionless is a term we use to describe the factthat no-one needs to grant permission or access tothese blockchains or tools. Literally anyone cancreate an account on these chains and start usingboth them, and the smart contracts on them.Decentralised is a term you’ll hear thrown around anever increasing amount, though with each actor usingit differently to suit their needs andinterpretations. We’ll be describing it simply as“neither governed nor controlled by a single definedactor”.So Tornado Cash was, put quite simply, a tool thatanyone could use to preserve the privacy of their on-chain transactions.The Foundations of theWestLike so many of our peers, we are firm believersthat the principles and ideas of Western liberalismare the correct ones.Freedom, your basic rights as an individual to speak,transact, and live without fear of unjustpersecution, arbitrary interference, or subject toinspection by some authoritarian body.We have written previously here about how we believeyour digital identity and your financial one – are inour modern age – one and the same. As the frontiersof technology continue to move forwards, particularlyin the realms of financial payments, settlement, anddigital identities, this truth will only become moreapparent.Since the dawn of democracy, it has been madeabundantly clear that a healthy and functional courtssystem is essential in ensuring these rights areupheld and not abused by those we elect to positionsof authority. As the markets that formed in thesedemocracies evolved, so too did the essential role ofthe regulator to ensure consumer protection and fairplay in the market.It should come as a stark warning then, that one ofthese democracies has gone so far as to pass averdict of guilt for a crime that has not beencommitted, but for one that may be committed in thefuture. One doesn’t need to be a Dutch legal practitioner torealise the profound misapplication and contortion ofthe law in order to secure a conviction. In a case of this nature under English law, in orderto prove conspiracy to commit money laundering, theprosecution must prove that the defendant: (1) agreedto conduct, or to attempt to conduct, a financialtransaction; (2) knew (suspicion is not enough as astate of mind) that the property involved in thetransaction represents the proceeds of crime, and (3)proof of intent to conceal the proceeds. Never in the history of liberalism has anyone everbeen found guilty of a crime that could potentiallybe committed by another, third party, at some time inthe future. A truly terrifying precedent to be set bythe court. This conviction grants a governmentunlimited power to prosecute any software developerwho writes code that is later used by a third partyfor nefarious purposes, merely because the developerbecomes aware of that later use. With no limitingprinciple in place, nearly all developers who createopen-source software would be exposed to criminalliability for activity outside of their control yearsor decades later. Put simply, the Dutch court’stheory of liability has the chilling effect ofrejecting core principles of due process and the ruleof law.Building for newPrecedentsWith the precedent now set that you can be imprisonedfor writing and releasing code that could be used bya sanctioned entity, all the builders of the worldshould be taking heed of the warning.Whilst the current target – privacy preservingtooling – may fall outside the scope of what you areworking on, given the gravitas of the ruling, wedon’t expect the contagion to stay there. Anythingfrom DeFi apps to SocialFi that “may” be used bysanctioned entities is now on the table for thecourt, and you should consider yourself at risk.With all that being said, we do believe there issufficient clarity for a robust direction forwards.This essay will outline some of this thinking, thoughit is not to be treated as any official kind ofcounsel, or legal advice. If you do feel in-need ofofficial guidance, please don’t hesitate to reach outto us.The basis of our thinking builds upon a handful ofmain factors;That the regulatory outlines and requirements forcompliance are increasingly clear;In our (widely shared) opinion, the correct way tobuild on-chain is permissionless and immutable;That privacy is an important individual right thatneeds protection; andThat there is clear precedent set for this.Regulatory ClarityAlbeit far from where we’d really like to be in termsof absolute clarity – as expected in maturing marketsectors – we are slowly arriving at clarity on theregulatory and compliance requirements for crypto andvirtual asset providers. For the builders in somejurisdictions, for the better. In others, the worse.The requirements for sanctions and AML screening, therestrictions and controls necessary to be in-place toachieve minimum standards for certain types ofdigital assets, and general diligence necessary to betaken seriously, are broadly speaking becomingdefined. Regardless of your personal ideology andviews of the sector, this is a good thing.The irony of writing these paragraphs given theruling we’re discussing as the centre-point of thisessay is not lost on us; simultaneously the rulingitself sets a degree of clarity. It’s now clear thatany privacy preserving software, on-chain or not, isnow within scope for legal persecution on theEuropean continent. Risk models should be updatedaccordingly.Technical PrecedentIt is true that no smart contract deployed to ablockchain can be modified. Once deployed thecontract itself is immutable. That being said, it isin fact possible to change the behaviour of aprotocol through various technical mechanisms thatare outside the scope of this essay. just take ourword for it (lookup upgradable contracts if you’rereally that interested)It has been an open debate for some time as towhether this approach should be endorsed –particularly for certain types of protocols – as theright way forwards.The benefits are obvious: the ability to upgrade andimprove the behaviour of a protocol with what wouldbe a seamless experience for users. The contracts are“upgraded” (technical implementation notwithstanding)and the users benefit.If smart contracts can be “upgraded” to improve theprotocol, it stands to reason that they can bechanged to enact behaviour to the owners’ own benefitonly – a compromise of the protocol if you will. Theidea that protocols should be immutable on-chain -i.e. being able to be trustedabsolutely such that wecan read the code,in-perpetuity, in the knowledgethey cannot be changed - is compelling. Uniswap as aprotocol is a clear and established demonstration ofthis.The Uniswap PrecedentThere are now 4 versions of the Uniswap protocolavailable. Each one a wholly new deployment of smartcontracts with no association to the previous. Thiswas by design. The contracts could not be “upgraded”to automatically distribute these new features orideas to users. Each user of the protocol – bothsides of the transaction – had to select whichversion(s) of the protocol they wanted to use. Tothis day, there are many newly released tokens thatare distributed on older versions of Uniswap forvarious reasons.What this does mean however is that as time movesforwards, the trust we can place in the contracts toalways behave in that manner, and not have securityrisks increases. Indeed, if there was a critical flawin the protocol that a threat actor could exploit, italmost certainly would have by now.It also provides the creators of Uniswap with a verypowerful defence against the rising tide ofregulation and scrutiny. Uniswap have reasonableneutrality as simply creators of “lower level” partsof the system.It’s that “lower level” aspect that is quitecritical. Even the most technically literate andcrypto-native of readers of this essay have likelynever actually interacted with Uniswap directly atthe protocol level. They’ll have almost certainlyused the Uniswap UI – the officially endorsed productimplementation – to perform whatever action they weretrying to.Layer 8 Problems The OSI LayersThere is a model we use in computer science calledthe “OSI Model”; a dated, albeit effective tool forunderstanding how our interconnected digital worldworks, each “layer” in the model a different positionin the card stack of abstractions we use to connectsystems, one on top of another until we arrive atwhat you experience as the modern internet. xkdc: DependencyA better view of what this means in practice would bethe above – an evergreen xkcd comic – about thehandful of developers who (thanklessly) continue todevelop and support critical “low level” packages andlibraries we use in our daily lives.There’s that “low level” denomination again.If Alexey is guilty of writing code that“foreseeably” could be used by sanctioned entities,then so are the developers of the encryption,networking, and browser libraries we all – even moreso the government – use daily to protect our digitalactivities; from not just authoritarian inspection,but from the general malice that permeates the world.The courts would never come after developers ofanything lower down in the OSI stack; a model that wefeel that today, does no longer accuratelyencapsulate the evolved complexity and abstractionsthat come with blockchains. In any other“traditional” system, implementing the relevantcontrols and regulations at the top of the stack wasdeemed sufficient. We don’t feel that there is anysubstantial reason for this to change.The design and development of immutable, composableprotocols – financial or otherwise – specificallywhere they are to be used on decentralised,permissionless blockchains, is no different fromdeveloping any other “low level” protocol. Theseprotocols must be immutable for any credible level oftrust to be placed in them, and thus are impossibleto comply with evolving regulatory requirements.Assuming the same set of developers who would likelygo on to build a high-level, user facing applicationthat simply leverages this and potentially otherprotocols, go on to implement any and all pertinentregulatory requirements and controls, there is noreason to believe that these developers had anyintention of sanctions busting or non-compliance.CloseWe should be thankful that there will be a secondcourt case, that for Tornado Cash co-author RomanStorm, held in the US; due instead this time for ajury trial, and not a Dutch three-judge-court. Weshall be keeping a close eye on how that unfolds,what evidence the US prosecutor can actually bring tobear to prove the charges, and how the juryinterprets each position. It is our deep personalhope that sanity prevails, and that the US maintainsits foundational commitment to individual liberties,in a time when its democracy remains again tested.We live in truly unprecedented times; where the ideaof something that isn’t a person can be subject tosanctions, and that a person can be found guilty ofsomething that may or may not happen in the future.We champion and support anyone standing against thealarming rise of illiberalism wherever it can befound, and look forwards to a future where personaland financial freedom for everyone is attainable inany format, private, or otherwise.The Dutch court was of the opinion that it should have been‘foreseeable’ to the software developers when they were writingthe Tornado Cash open source code that, at some unspecified datein the future, money originating from crime could be deposited intothe smart contracts, taking advantage of the concealing effect ofthe tool. It was on this basis of “foreseeability” - that theseimmutable contracts might one day be used by a sanctioned entity to launder money - that Alexey was found guilty. The court viewed Tornado’s privacy protection function as afunction to conceal - which amounted to conspiracy to moneylaundering under Dutch law. By doing so, the judges assumed therewas no legitimate use case for privacy and treated the developersas responsible for the creation of a tool of potential misuse. None of these elements exist in the case of software developerswho create and deploy immutable smart contract protocols, andnone of them were proven in this case.Daniel MilesJun 13, 2024\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Powered by Ghost STRAININewAlchemy-DeFiTurnsMetalsLiquid Following on from our last post on Real World Assets(RWAs), its clear that liquidity is needed to bringmany such projects to fruition. DeFi, with its easeof transaction and confidence in code, is an idealcandidate to bring grand vision of RWAs to life. Thisarticle lays out the bird's eye view of how thismight begin to mechanically work.Stratified CostsMany RWA projects face internally stratified costs.In the case of commodity or precious metals; it canbe more difficult to bring one component part of thesame combined asset to fruition; ground gets hotterand ores get denser the deeper one digs. One canstraightforwardly imagine a way to arbitrage excessdemand into supply of such a component, the same wayany crowdfunder goes to market and says: But scaling this model, especially under CeFi, haslimited flexibility. Transaction fees are sickening,high value transactions have to be individuallyapproved by law, conversion into more advantageouscurrencies wherever you are is expensive; everythingworks worse, but is entrenched and so is defaultedto. Moreover, CeFi, by its declaration and disclosurerequirements, promotes the sorts of perverseincentives which set up oligopolies in exactly thesort of new markets we want to be competitive. How?Well, remember those higher costs? Those are alreadyraising barriers to entry, and, more importantly,promoting strong selection biases for those who canget past them to economise at scale. Combine thiswith the knowledge that you can only get as far asone disclosed jurisdiction plus its connectionsbefore competitors jump on you, and it doesn't makesense to run the completely honest go to market whichthese economic models are fundamentally predicatedon, especially if I've reached the point where Idon't need to do this. Too big to fail, too grandiosefor candour. It instead makes sense to channel yourinner Julius II, and Treaty of Tordesillas yourselfand any competitors into strictly defined zones wherethere's less competition and the consumer ultimatelyloses.DeFi can fix this both for the ambitious producerand, by extension, consumers, even if they nevernotice it. I'd almost go as far as to say theconsumer not needing to focus on their financialsystem is a compliment.Tokens As RightsImagine that some variation of the Green New Deal,mandatory ESG, so on so forth, actually becomes law.I own a Lithium mine, and demand goes stratosphericbecause now all those additional batteries which haveto go in those electric cars need my commodity towork profitably. However, as above, parts of mydeposit previously didn't make sense to exploit, and,even with this newfound sovereign backed demand, somesmaller part still doesn't. We now have three tiersof stratified product going to the same ends. CeFidoesn't allow for easy arbitration on this, nevermind elegant expression of how that cost is going tovary.Now, imagine that I issue a token instead, which,upon certain requirements being met, entitles theholder to the produce, or profit equivalent of, thismine, corresponding to the volume of tokens theyhold. The advantages for me are obvious; I'm notlocked into long term instruments, I can market forliquidity much more widely, and I'm not subject toCeFi mission creep. I can also market all of thesethings as points to investors and consumers alike.On top of that, I can treat the different strata ofmy product with bespoke tokens, or change the releaseorder to simulate that difference, or do any one of ahundred other things. Importantly, I have animmediately flexible way to respond to demand,because demand can now be more directly signalled. Ifthe globe gets hotter than expected and regulationstighten further, I can open up operations into thatthird strata with code in seconds, whereas a paralleloperation in CeFi would involve vis maior clauses inthe innumerable contracts I've signed, which go toany number of arbitrators, so on and so forth. Muchmore costly for everyone involved; far moredistorting on the actual price consumers end uppaying, especially where demand inelastic goods areconcerned.Less obvious, and far more powerful, are theadditional benefits to investors. Like me, theyaren't locked into long term financial contracts.They can trust the code, rather than eleven differentbankers and all their incentives. There's now, justas in any other DeFi space, a market on those tokens.You don't have to care about Lithium to get involvedin my venture now - you can directly speculatestrictly on the financial returns without any CeFirestrictions getting in the way.This then allows all manner of interested andspecialist parties to get involved in their own way;yield farming, options, ETF's; we can directly plughigh fixed costs projects into the liquidity marketsthey need to get prices down and wealth in real termsup. Human deception and error can be eliminatedbecause, code is the law here. Tying back to theabove, the lack of disclosure requirements reduceswhat my competitors know about my capabilities andambitions. It's now decision theory, rather thangeneral game theory. They're forced back intobehaving like exactly that, competitors; I'm forcedinto actually carving out what I want based onproduct quality and customer service, rather thancornering the supply ahead of time and maximising formy own surplus.I can feel Hayek smiling from here.Come One, Come AllAll of the above is true in the case of one commoditywith a specific range of use cases and a variablecost. However, mines aren't pure. Going back to myexample, Magnesium is often found alongside Lithium.Like Lithium, Magnesium has a range of commercial usecases. If its lightweight and electric, or needs tomaintain internal stability at high speed, itprobably has Magnesium in it, but notice that theseuse cases are subtly different from Lithium. Havingenjoyed my runaway success tokenising Lithium, andnoticing the low XED in my products, I want totokenise Magnesium too.And now comes the cherry on top; liquidity pools.DeFi, can, by setting up a pool of tokensrepresenting my Lithium supply compared againsttokens representing my Magnesium supply, do more thaneliminate extortionate CeFi currency arbitrage. This rests on some assumptions, but not necessarilythe ones you'd intuit. My ownership of the mine atthis stage doesn't matter very much - once the tokensare out in the world for exchange, as long as themine keeps mining, who owns it matters very little.The core assumption is that whatever rate of supplyall this overlay infrastructure was posed on remainsinside tolerance limits. This is, as with every otherfinancial instrument, more true as you rack up risk.The heavier I bet on Lithium against Magnesium, orvice versa, if supply of one stops, I'm in trouble.But there's no reason for this risk to becomeexistential to the given DeFi system; much less sothan in CeFi because, again, code is law. There's noincentive for larger agents to conspire to push theleverage beyond what's sane, knowing that thetaxpayer will backstop them - there's no taxpayerhere.This also allows consortiums of smaller retailinvestors access to profits reserved forinstitutional actors under CeFi. Say a well-performing retail investor gets news of incomingregulation; my Magnesium extraction operation goes sowell that I've flooded some electronics manufacturingmarket somewhere, and the price is going to fallimminently, causing some other tokenised and pooledasset to rise in response (which need not be Lithiumat this point). Well, they can take out a flash loanand arbitrage on the price hike on the othercommodity - easy profit, directly to consumers.C.F. Fiat StablesComparing against fiat stables provides furtherelucidation. Counterparty risk is (largely)ameliorated by using a commmodity - as long as thereis liquid demand for the underlying commodity andconfidence in the token, there'll be someone lookingto purchase. This is not the case where underlyingfiat positions are being abandoned or rolled back.Some others would have been in the worse position offactoring their structural inequalities into theirdistribution, but MiCA more or less kills anypossibility of a competitive European stable.A niche, but perhaps, dare I say, dull market in theunderlying commodity is advisable; those in broaderdemand or with more dangerous applications are likelyto have their movements around the globe regulatedand tracked - all complications project directly ontoany pegged token. This must in turn be reconciledwith logistical constraints and liquidity concerns -the backer can be as confident as they like, but thestable is still limited by the total market of theunderlying commodity. Perhaps some fractionation isin order - it's difficult for me to ship rare earthmetals around the globe on a whim, but if Iincorporate them into a larger order of more commondeliverables, average prices start dropping.Similarly, if my token (and, chemistry allowing,physical currency to match) is based on a rarercommodity to the extent that a price is readilyderivable, I can, up to my established risk appetite,build that into something more commonplace to easeliquidity concerns, and effectively optioniseliquidity.I mention physical coinage representing a token asanother approach to liquidity problems, especiallyones related to friction and uptake. If it becomesjust the next kind of cash, the average person canuse what is also a stable and a token from theirphysical wallet, as well as a chain one. All that isnecessary is drumming up the underlying capital tomatch the token with parallel coinage, and convincingwhichever central banks one intends to target thatintroducing this parallel coinage won't havedisastrous effects. An awful lot certainly, but, avisible amount. This is perhaps the most heterodoxambition in this paper, but in a deglobalising world,I remain hopeful. Those who choose to break from thedollar over pride, prerogative or prudence could finda cooler political alternative in a decentralised,private option, set apart from centralisedgeopolitical intrigue and diorama. Especially injurisdictions where cash substitution is a longrunning issue - none of the political friction ofCBDC's (nor expenses incurred in building thenecessary infrastructure on the public purse), easyintegration into all extant markets, and directtracking, assuming some mechanism to correspond ahybrid coin to its token (the most difficult part tobuild into a technology which would try to solve boththese problems at once, but necessary lest doublespending take hold everywhere). An ATM likedispensary connected to a wallet might be a goodstart.But, drawing our metaphor to a close: if I don't likehow separate my Lithium and Magnesium markets are,even if I can address them separately, and tokenisethose efforts, how about I fuse the two with a tokenmade of 50% Lithium, 50% Magnesium? Ok, don't put itin water, or heated air, or pure oxygen... but youget the point. Liquidity (or reactivity) concerns?Just dilute into a different ratio with a parallelrefining product and resume the process.Especially if favoured counterparties could be madeready, waiting to provide liquidity across thebarrier until it dissolves, and then translatecustomers into the new paradigm once I decide to makerid of it. Instant market-wide efficiencyimprovements, and wider uptake appeal.I'd have triangulated demand between, and therebyprofit maximised the supply of, my individualproducts, derivatives thereof, and fusionstherebetween, in one fell swoop. Oh, yeah, andcreated a parallel financial ecosystem, limited onlyby scale and adoption.Aut Caesar, Aut Nihil.Concluding NecessitiesIt's not obvious where such a system should be basedor begin from. Stables would make a good place tostart, and neither the EU nor US is a good home forthem right now; this will be further commented onlater.Further, as you've likely surmised, it's likely tomake CeFi, and all its institutional power, very,very angry, long before DeFi figures out itsadvertising and comprehensibility problems. In anuncertain, de-globalising world, only relativelyinsulated and uninvested jurisdictions make obvioushomes, and the US isn't a good place to start as longas the SEC maintains its current course. Mexico,Canada and Australia might all be strong candidateswith commodities connections and some kind of shockinsulation from changes in trading markets.However, for the ambitious, I can think of no bettertriple offensive to legitimate DeFi, establish alegacy which spans the transition from CeFi intoDeFi, and which garners prestige to last generations.All remaining notes concern judicious deployment; farbetter handled by operatives than ideates.'Hey, please give me money for x, you'll get y in response [ahead oftime]' even if y is just feeling charitable.

Powered by Ghost Sibylline has been supporting it’s clients in thedesign and usage of AI models across a multitude ofbusiness verticals and befittingly we wanted to sharehow we think about the emerging trends and patternsin the sector much like our other work.It might seem almost cliché to be jumping on the AIbandwagon like so many others, but our partners havebeen building and shipping AI products back when goodGPT models were in their infancy, and more than ayear before the introduction of the ChatGPT productthat popularised them.IntroductionWhen we talk about the most recent advances in AI,they come across in 2 key main verticals;Diffusion Models - such as DALL-E and Mid JourneyLarge Language Models (LLMs) - Models such as GPT-4and LLAMAWhilst there have been incredible advances in thegenerative AI section, especially across theoreticalsectors such as healthcare and neuroscience, our workis mostly focussed around the use and deployment ofLLMs and natural language, and and is where thisseries will keep its focus.But what exactly are LLMs and natural language? Thispassage from a soon to be released white-paper weauthored for a client explains; Natural TranslatorsLLMs are exceptionally good at getting from one formof language to another, be it from one interpretationof a text to another, between whole other languages,or where some of the most important advances arebeing made, getting from language that peopleunderstand, to one that machines do.The process of getting from what users want to do insoftware to the machines actually doing it has beenone of the most important and studied fields inmodern software engineering. It drives everythingfrom the foundational APIs and primitives we buildupon, to the user interfaces and design choices thatare made. LLMs in this regard, are the translators we\\'ve alwaysbeen looking for to help get us from the language ofexpressiveness and nuance that we humans use everyday, to the language of rules that is necessary forcomputers to function.There’s no clearer example of this than GithubCopilot, a product designed to support engineers inwriting code — the language of rules that machinesare governed by — from simple human readablecomments. A very simplistic demonstration of Copilot in actionPrompt MachinesThe use of LLMs is not however, just limited totranslation. These models similarly fall under the\"generative AI\" banner for a reason; when given alimited input, prompt, or question, you can leveragethem to generate or complete the content or answerfor you. This enables them to fill interesting rolesin the search and chat functions.There\\'s a common misconception around models such asthese that they\\'re sat atop some massive database ofall known knowledge to answer questions, much in thesame way a normal search engine is. This isn\\'t quiteaccurate (albeit yes the new Bing and Bard productsto leverage AI with their traditional search enginedatabases). These models are trained on massivedatasets that allow them to predict the answer – withincredible accuracy – to your question.Sibylline was named after the Sibylline books,ancient books purchased from a Sibyl by the last kingof Rome, and consulted upon during times of greatcrisis. The word Sibyl is derived from the ancientgreek sibylla or prohpetess; those who would giveanswers towards those who provide good questions.LLMs operate on a similar premise. The responses thatthese models create are formed from not just theinput question that you provide, but also from thesurrounding context, additional input information,and \"prompting\". All of these collectively go in todraw the attention of the model to the next correcttoken, leading to the most accurate answer. Or as Stephen Wolfram succinctly put it...its overall goal is to continue text in a “reasonable” way, based onwhat it’s seen from the training it’s had (which consists in lookingat billions of pages of text from the web, etc.) So at any givenpoint, it’s got a certain amount of text—and its goal is to come upwith an appropriate choice for the next token to add.ClosingThe AI industry is advancing at a rapid pace, withinnovations being unveiled so quickly it seems wemight need our own platform to keep pace—an ideaproposed internally and echoed by our clients.As mentioned, this is the first in a series of postsabout our work and experiments in the AI domain andhow we guide clients in harnessing its potential.Throughout this series, we\\'ll delve into:Our strategy for identifying and validatingeffective AI use-cases and deployments to addressreal client problems, and avoiding hype-driveninvestmentsTechnical breakdowns of how we build and deploycost-effective LLM solutions for our internal toolsand projectsStories from our journeys with clients,highlighting the process of unlocking the power ofAI for their businessesLook forwards to having you follow us for the ride!Natural LanguageNatural language refers to the ways humans communicate usingeither spoken or written words and naturally arises in humansocieties as a means of communication. Most of the languages wespeak on this planet fall under the umbrella of “natural language”.Natural language is both complex and flexible, and allows ushumans to express a wide range of ideas, emotions, and concepts,but it’s also innately ambiguous. It’s this ambiguity that computersstruggle to understand, and where the field of natural languageprocessing comes in. There are no fixed rules in natural language,and even if there were, a significant portion of the speakingpopulation would not follow them; this is the origin of slang andlocal dialects.Natural language processing instead turned to the world ofstatistics to glean insight into language and how to make itmachine usable, with the most recent breakthrough in this fieldcoming in the form of “Large Language Models”Large Language ModelLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a form of artificial intelligencebuilt on top of deep learning architectures, initially such as NeuralNetworks, but more recently leveraging what are called“Transformer” models, an approach initially pioneered by GoogleLLMs were popularised by OpenAI with their release of the ChatGPTproduct; a simple interface for conversing with their latest GPT3.5LLM model. This model surpassed all models at the time at the testsavailable, and captured the imagination of the world as itdemonstrated the real power of LLMs in action, producing someincredible works of writing, code, and insight with what seemed liketrivial effortIn practice, this model was simply the industrial application ofnatural language processing. The contextual meaning of sentencesbeing passed to it, and the expected reply to them, was understoodand created through the intensive statistical analysis of a massivedataset on machine learning models with billions of parameters.Daniel MilesJul 10, 2023 Subscribe', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Powered by Ghost “The Wallet” is both correctly regarded andsimultaneously wholly underappreciated as the mostimportant innovation in the Web3 sector. Whilst it istrue that there have been countless innovations inthe space across user experiences and permissionlessDeFi, it is this single core concept that truly holdsthe power to revolutionise how we interact with thedigital world, and it is because of this reason thatwe should be building forwards from this “WalletCentric” view.ForewordFor the majority of 2022, I worked at a Web3 walletstartup that aimed to transform how we interact withWeb3 in its current form. There were clear challengesthat we specifically went after, and hence born themoniker “user experience infrastructure startup”,given everything we did was catered around solvingvery clear UX issues. A wallet that solved the key management problem. Awallet that solved the gas-cost interaction problem.A wallet that solved the ramp problem. Simplyhowever, just a wallet.There are lots of people looking at one or some ofthese challenge and from different angles, but for areally complete experience, we knew that whatever thefinal product was it needed to be seamless; centralto the customer experience, and everywhere.It is from this base position, and conversations I’vehad around it, that I’ve refined my thinking. If youhaven’t already, I thoroughly recommend the “WalletCentric Customer Experience Stack” by Ben Basche.Recent conversations with him have only reinforced myviews here.IdentitiesWhat is a wallet? At a base technical level it can beas simple as a public/private key pair, or as complexas an on-chain smart contract. At a philosophicallevel however?It’s a key to your digital identity. An identity youneed to do anything online.Digital identity is something that we’ve beenexploring for decades now, even long before the firstsmart contracts were written. It’s come in manyshapes and forms; from the humble username andpassword, to the behemoth that is OAuth.Cyber security professionals have wrestled withidentity since cyber was a thing, modelling the bestway to place who someone is, and what they can do,with some models being more successful than others.These models were all incomplete.It turns out that your digital identity and yourfinancial identity are in fact inextricably linked.We have built billions of dollars of products andinfrastructure around this key fact. Paypal, Stripe,Apple Pay; all products that attempt to wrangle these2 separate identities into something a little lesspainful to manage.Consider the customer experience of almost all sitesthese days. You’ll likely login with Google orFacebook, proceed to find the thing that you want, beit a service or a product, and then go to some kindof checkout flow. This checkout flow will allow youto select from one of the integrated paymentssolutions, be it something more seamless such asApple Pay — which has gone to great lengths toattempt to merge these 2 identities — or moretraditionally built solutions such as Stripecheckout. Removing from the equation the heavilyconvoluted settlement layer that is our traditionalfinancial infrastructure, it’s pretty clear thatreally the most desirable experience here is onewhere all of these payment methods come with yourdigital identity;Or that your financial identity was in fact what you used onlineinsteadI’d posit that if “Login with your bank” was anoption because they pioneered OAuth alongside Google, it would have been incredibly popular. You’dalready be KYC-ed if that was necessary, paymentswould “just work” and would be secured using the sameteams that keep your money safe in the bank.ExperiencesOutside of revolutionary changes in Human InterfaceDevices such as the newly released Apple Vision Pro,the base experience apps should have is a prettysolved problem.Pull down to refresh. Swipe to go back. Single clicklogin gets you to the start of the value chain.It\\'s been made abundantly clear that the seed-phrasebased approach to wallets thus far is completelyunfit for purpose in that regard. Users don\\'t want tohave to manage their seed phrases, no more than theywant to manage their own email server.The Wallet Centric experience starts here, with acreation and “login\" (read: connect) flow that looksand feels almost identical to the login flows we havetoday, getting users to the key value of your productquickly and with low friction.This isn’t a particularly out-there realisation.Several of the biggest names in the space — Uniswapnotably among them — have decided that the “embeddedwallet” native within their mobile app experience isthe way forwards. These approaches work for getting alarger wedge of market-share by capturing those whochurn due to entry costs; good for their short-termusage numbers, but eliminates key parts of the valueof a true wallet-centric experience. The contents of my wallet should allow my experienceto be tailored. This can’t be done when itsfragmented across multiple wallets where I would haveto export the private key to move it around.Ramps and RailsHalfway through writing this piece someone sent meSimon Taylors Future of Payments blog; in there beinga particularly pertinent comment; Crypto can act as payment rails, a point Simon alsocalls out, but independently it can act as acustodian. If I want to access DeFi pools with aboveaverage returns or escape my countries currencyvolatility and hedge it by simply holding stables, Iwant to have a combined digital and financialidentity that can allow me to do this.My previous Letter to DeFi talks about how the futureof DeFi will look a lot more like a modern Neobankthan it does what we have today. There I also touchbriefly about how if you were to build one around aWallet Centric experience, you could create somethingseriously compelling, and indeed there are someplayers barking at this thesis.Behind this experience you can then begin to abstractaway the ever increasing number of payment rails thatare being created — and the crypto ramps that want toservice them — reaping the benefits that these teamsare creating in attempting to create smooth fiatrails for customers as you float between the 2systems.A value proposition that can now be brought to allapps; a single contact point for developers to buildfrom and a single identity for users, fiat and cryptobuilt in.As a passing comment I suspect this is Coinbase’s tolose. They have an exceptionally strong position inbeing one of the biggest on-ramps into crypto at themoment — one that’s also attempting to do it properlyno less — and are actively pursuing a “Wallet as aService” strategy. I highly suspect that the naturalevolution of centralised exchanges will converge tobanking which leaves Coinbase; then a bank with adigital wallet identity and deep token liquidity,sitting in an incredibly strong position. I digress,an essay for another time.The LoopThe future of crypto/”web3”/whatever will have usersenter because they arrived at an app they wanted touse, ”logged in” and proceeded to have an identitycreated for them.Where this has been done through a wallet-centricapproach, it’ll be this same identity they have whenthey arrive at the next app they want to use. Thecold-start problem here is ensuring that apps want tobuild from a particular wallet because they solvegenuine user challenges such as rails, gas, or chaincomplexity.The loop arrives when apps want to build out fromthis wallet because they understand that this wherethe users already are.Merchants accept specific payment methods becausethey want to attract and capture the users that arefound within those systems. The future of digitalidentities will have apps building around theidentity instead, knowing that with it comes thefinancial identity with the relevant rails becausethey’re now one and the same.It’s here that once the base experiences have beensolved, that the “identity providers” will begin todifferentiate.Providers can open up more APIs to developers totailor their experiences further, be it from newloyalty offers, to financing options or even cross-chain. Alternatively the experience might be morestraight-jacketed, ensuring that the experienceacross apps is always reproducible and understood,attracting a host of users who churn at too muchchoice and want to simply access a very simple andrefined digital experience. Winners here will, asever, be the ones that can identify what users andbuilders want and iterate to get the right productmarket fit the quickest.Whichever provider masters the “personas” challenge,allowing me to have uniquely tailored experiencesdepending on a certain identity I currently want touse, but without having to “login” to entirely newsystems and break out of flow, stands a strong chanceof creating a very defensible base offering.ClosingOur current digital identities are badly overdue anoverhaul, but simple changes over the “Login” floware insufficient to realise the true potential here.How digital identities should feel is a solvedconsumer problem. No-one but the maxi’s insisted onhaving to manage your own private keys, and theirtime is short lived.How financial identities should behave is a solvedconsumer problem, with minor iterations enabling newexperiences in certain spaces but build onfundamentally the wrong primitives.The convergence of these 2 identities will enable allusers to project themselves digitally in the way thatthey’re supposed to, not missing out on certainexperiences just because they made the wrong consumerchoice of what card issuer they went with.Fundamentally however, we were a wallet startup. I don’t have multiple identities across multiple apps where each apphas created a key-pair for me.I have one identity (perhaps with N personas, more on that later)which I want to project into all of my digital experiences. India, the home of UPI and digital identity, doesn\\'t yet have an openbanking standard, which suggests identity is the proper foundationof payments if you were to start again.

Powered by Ghost DeFiiscompletelyunusableTradFiiscompletelybrokenayyImao The future of DeFi will look nothing like itcurrently does if it is to ever achieve either itsmission or absolute full potential. The sector has anincredible amount of upside but is finding itselfhampered by a lack of focus, arrogance, anduncertainty.The BackdropDecentralised finance, shortened to simply DeFi, isthe fundamental notion that access to financialservices and security should be a universal right,and that we can leverage decentralised technologiesto be able to realise this idea.Blockchain and crypto technology can be used to bringus products that allow us to swap currencies andother tokens, safely store digital value, trade andexchange this value, and earn a return on that valuethrough various mechanisms, all outside of the majorcentralised institutions and without needing anyexplicit permission to use them.Current StateThe current state of DeFi is frankly, an absolutemess. Plain and simple. The blame here isn’t all forDeFi, the crypto industry in general is in need ofmaturing right across the board.Currently most of the volume and product launches arestill being targeted towards speculators and aliquorice assortment of other bad actors. I’m notsaying speculation is intrinsically bad, but if thisis all this industry amounts to be, then that will beexceptionally disappointing.Crypto in general is suffering heavily — nearmortally — from a user experience problem. The simpleidea of getting a wallet, buying some tokens, tradingthem, paying for something, or other actual usefulapplications of the space, is obtusely challenging,even for tech literate people.Genuine, sector-changing attempts to tackle theseproblems are being hemmed in by ideologues and othermaxi’s who think that “oh but if its not completelyperfectly decentralised or trustless or blah thenit’s clearly bad”. It’s time for them to grow up.I’ll be writing a whole other piece around the“principles vs mass adoption” argument so I won’t getinto it too much here, but at a base level, it’sinsane that I even need to argue it. The time of thegatekeepers is coming to an end.The NeedThe technical capability to drive serious change isalready here. I was part of an elite team last yearthat spent their entire time dedicated to solvingthese problems; and we did. There are plenty of teamsout there that are seriously trying to drive theneedle forwards, but hemmed in by this idea of “thisisn’t where the market is right now” and in somesense thats true, the mistake being that if theythink just servicing the current load of speculatorsis the only market there is, they’re wrong.The future of DeFi will look a lot more like a bank than it willwhatever we have today.If we break down the world of consumer finance, itbecomes pretty clear what the market has decided itwants:Store my money safely and let me spend it where Iwant to, how I want to, and don’t charge me toomuch to do thatLet me save some of this money and maybe generate areturn on that. If you could outperform inflation,that would be awesome.Let me send money to other people easily and safely(not safely comes second, as CashApp demonstrated)If you ever find yourselves in the upper echelons ofthe financial consumer, you might also want:The ability to take loans and other credit productsThe ability to unlock liquidity in certain assets,such as wanting to refinance a house Same EnergyCurrently it is incredibly non-trivial to be able todo these things in DeFi, though thats not to say theprimitives don’t exist. There is infrastructure andproducts out there that if you squint at looks almostexactly like this, but using it is basicallyimpossible;There are lots products around spending cryptoonline, and in-person. These are particularlyrampant in Latin America where the desire to getaway from their native currency systems ispalpable.You don’t have to go very far to find mechanismsfor earning yield in DeFi, even when you strip awaythe ponzi schemes.Sending tokens between two wallets was literallyone of the first use cases for crypto, just doingit isn’t a very enjoyable experience.And with recent innovations we’re able to find;Platforms for unlocking liquidity in assets such asNFTsReal World Asset (RWA) platforms that areattempting to bring things like real-estate on-chain though these are very much still in theirinfancyThat Latin America point is quite poignant. Those ofus that live in The West have this warped view of theworld about what crypto really is and and how itsbeing used, but throughout emerging markets, you’llfind real people who use it day-to-day to exchangemoney for regular household goods because even thishostile experience is worth it to them. They deserveto be serviced better.The VisionThe future of DeFi will, to consumers, look a lotlike modern Neobanks than they do their current form.There will be more than 1 player. They will choose todifferentiate in different ways. This is the sign ofa mature market.They will be “wallet centric” apps similar to Neobankapps but not quite like how they look in either ofthem today. This app will be a gateway and key into ahost of new apps, but you’d never know it; it’ll becleanly abstracted away. This might be because thewallet provider itself, and the bank provider areseparate entities, it might not be. The market willwork out which of these models will work (more onwallet centrism in another post)The app itself will be denominated in actual nativecurrencies. Wallets denominating on ETH isridiculous. ETH is not a currency, SOL isn’t acurrency. USDC is a currency.Users will be able to spend their money usingtraditional rails, and new ones. There will be debitcards that work on traditional rails, and productsthat manage this complexity will have strong moats.We can transfer money to raw addresses, resolvableaddresses such as ENS, or other KYC-ed pieces of datawhere they want to such as phone numbers or emails.This KYC data might be on-chain but private, it mightnot be. Either way the consumer market will requiretrivial mechanisms for the transfer of their moneybetween their friends, and the market will provideit.You’ll be able to recover their accounts. Trust willbe put in entities or mechanisms that are consideredintrinsically safe. For those who choose not to havethis luxury and insist it must be trustless, therewill be mechanisms for them too, though thecomplexity will increase accordingly. This will beokay, but won’t be the norm. The gatekeepers andmaxi’s will shout, they are to be ignored *cough,ledger, cough*A Cambrian explosion of new types of “savingsaccounts” will arrive, powered by the permissionlesson-chain primitives of DeFi, finally unlocking itstrue power. Billions in liquidity will pour intopools, tokenised asset classes, project funds tobankroll initiatives people actually care about withverified returns, and all without needing to huntthem down in a fractured online nebula, an exercisewe know most users simply do not care about.People will be able to see completely how their moneyis being a force for good in the world, the carbonits removing, the charities its helping, the smallbusinesses that are growing. It’ll be tracked andrewarded on-chain, and with it a new host of consumerbenefits will arrive, with brands looking to targettheir specific niche of customer, creating new go-to-market strategies, and consumer choice.Money shall be transacted. Preference shall besignalled not presumed. Experiences shall be tailorednot modelled. The birds shall sing, and the sun shallshine.LandscapeThere is currently a handful of players who are allbarking at this thesis, but there is still such along way to go. A few honourable mentions I’ve beentracking;Ultimate. These started out as a DeFi specificwallet, which naturally falls under that whole“servicing the current speculators” thesis, but arechasing down the Neobank play. It’s an interestingGTM if they can execute it right having alreadycaptured the speculators, now can they service theregular consumer.Meld. These guys went the other way, building out aclear Neobank-on-top-of-wallet play first, and havedone a pretty polished job of it. If they canexecute an effective GTM and product roadmap, couldbe curious to watchPrivy. An execution against “Web3 wallet for allthe users”. They’re shaping up nicely to capturethe mass-adoption wallet market. Should this becoupled with the right DeFi experience; couldeasily be a contender to bring the DeFi revolutionwe deserve.I’m sure there are others, and I’m sure twitter willhave fun pointing them out to me.The InstitutionsInstitutions are not taking this lying down. Almostall of them are exploring what this means to theirbusinesses; I talk to a lot of them. They, however,have more explicit and clear requirements of whatthey want and need out of the space; and what they’dbe prepared to tolerate to get into it, somethingwe’ll save for another post.As the biggest names in traditional finance havedeclared that “tokenisation is the future” so toohave the lines in the sand been drawn; this isn’tgoing away.As TradFi bring their massive portfolios, riskappetites, and debt servicing, partnering it with theefficient, liquid, and open markets that DeFiprovides, we’re destined to enter a new golden age offinancial products for retail consumers not just inthe west, but across the world.Thinking that the sector itself is somehow better offwithout their interest or involvement is just silly.Yes DeFi was in part born out of the notion thattraditional finance has failed us — and in many casesit undoubtably has — but for it to really mature intothe revolution it deserves to be, it’s time to putdown the pitchforks and torches and have sensibleconversations about what that looks like.The regulatory scene is going to change aroundcrypto, in the same way that it will all of finance.This pipe-dream that you can just run around in thecrypto industry with no care or interest for consumerprotection, international law, and basic financialprudence, is exactly that, a pipe dream. If this isyou, grow up.This isn’t to say that DeFi won’t be revolutionarychange, it will. Being borderless and permissionlesswill allow global financial paradigm shift that meanseveryone everywhere can access the financialprimitives they deserve, in a manner that doesn’trequire you to have a masters degree in computerscience to be able to use it not get scammed alongthe way.Closing RemarkIt’s time for this sector to evolve on-the-whole.It’s time for the gatekeepers to be moved aside. Notjust so that we can realise the full potential andvision of DeFi, but so that the innovations we makealong the way can unlock whole new ways of living andstructuring society. The market has clearly signalledhow it is prepared to interact with the digitalworld, it’s time we come and meet them there andservice it.Daniel MilesJun 14, 2023Blog Subscribe', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Wespecifically chose to start this series here and onthis thesis as it represents the fruits of months ofthinking and development. In light of recent reportscoming from the Dutch court – the guilty verdict ofTornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev – it is now,more than ever, pertinent.Background Tornado Cash is what we call a “mixer”. A specialtype of privacy-preserving tool that runs onpermissionless, decentralised blockchains. That’s alot of words to the uninitiated, so let’s break themdown.A blockchain is an immutable ledger (read: database)of who sent what tokens to who, and when. Some fancycryptography ensures that this ledger cannot betampered with, and thus is always valid. This is thepower and simplicity of a blockchain. Thisfundamental design means that we can always tracewhere money or on-chain assets originated from, andwho they’re going to, a sort of directed graph thatshows us where money started and every step it tookto get to the other end. A mixer is a simple smartcontract (read: program) that runs on these chainsthat accepts deposits from anyone, and “mixes” it alltogether in a way that makes whoever redeems adeposit impossible to distinguish from the depositorthemselves by breaking the observable link between adeposit and a withdrawal address.It proves – verysimply – a mechanism for creating on-chain privacyfor transactions.Permissionless is a term we use to describe the factthat no-one needs to grant permission or access tothese blockchains or tools. Literally anyone cancreate an account on these chains and start usingboth them, and the smart contracts on them.Decentralised is a term you’ll hear thrown around anever increasing amount, though with each actor usingit differently to suit their needs andinterpretations. We’ll be describing it simply as“neither governed nor controlled by a single definedactor”.So Tornado Cash was, put quite simply, a tool thatanyone could use to preserve the privacy of their on-chain transactions.The Foundations of theWestLike so many of our peers, we are firm believersthat the principles and ideas of Western liberalismare the correct ones.Freedom, your basic rights as an individual to speak,transact, and live without fear of unjustpersecution, arbitrary interference, or subject toinspection by some authoritarian body.We have written previously here about how we believeyour digital identity and your financial one – are inour modern age – one and the same. As the frontiersof technology continue to move forwards, particularlyin the realms of financial payments, settlement, anddigital identities, this truth will only become moreapparent.Since the dawn of democracy, it has been madeabundantly clear that a healthy and functional courtssystem is essential in ensuring these rights areupheld and not abused by those we elect to positionsof authority. As the markets that formed in thesedemocracies evolved, so too did the essential role ofthe regulator to ensure consumer protection and fairplay in the market.It should come as a stark warning then, that one ofthese democracies has gone so far as to pass averdict of guilt for a crime that has not beencommitted, but for one that may be committed in thefuture. One doesn’t need to be a Dutch legal practitioner torealise the profound misapplication and contortion ofthe law in order to secure a conviction. In a case of this nature under English law, in orderto prove conspiracy to commit money laundering, theprosecution must prove that the defendant: (1) agreedto conduct, or to attempt to conduct, a financialtransaction; (2) knew (suspicion is not enough as astate of mind) that the property involved in thetransaction represents the proceeds of crime, and (3)proof of intent to conceal the proceeds. Never in the history of liberalism has anyone everbeen found guilty of a crime that could potentiallybe committed by another, third party, at some time inthe future. A truly terrifying precedent to be set bythe court. This conviction grants a governmentunlimited power to prosecute any software developerwho writes code that is later used by a third partyfor nefarious purposes, merely because the developerbecomes aware of that later use. With no limitingprinciple in place, nearly all developers who createopen-source software would be exposed to criminalliability for activity outside of their control yearsor decades later. Put simply, the Dutch court’stheory of liability has the chilling effect ofrejecting core principles of due process and the ruleof law.Building for newPrecedentsWith the precedent now set that you can be imprisonedfor writing and releasing code that could be used bya sanctioned entity, all the builders of the worldshould be taking heed of the warning.Whilst the current target – privacy preservingtooling – may fall outside the scope of what you areworking on, given the gravitas of the ruling, wedon’t expect the contagion to stay there. Anythingfrom DeFi apps to SocialFi that “may” be used bysanctioned entities is now on the table for thecourt, and you should consider yourself at risk.With all that being said, we do believe there issufficient clarity for a robust direction forwards.This essay will outline some of this thinking, thoughit is not to be treated as any official kind ofcounsel, or legal advice. If you do feel in-need ofofficial guidance, please don’t hesitate to reach outto us.The basis of our thinking builds upon a handful ofmain factors;That the regulatory outlines and requirements forcompliance are increasingly clear;In our (widely shared) opinion, the correct way tobuild on-chain is permissionless and immutable;That privacy is an important individual right thatneeds protection; andThat there is clear precedent set for this.Regulatory ClarityAlbeit far from where we’d really like to be in termsof absolute clarity – as expected in maturing marketsectors – we are slowly arriving at clarity on theregulatory and compliance requirements for crypto andvirtual asset providers. For the builders in somejurisdictions, for the better. In others, the worse.The requirements for sanctions and AML screening, therestrictions and controls necessary to be in-place toachieve minimum standards for certain types ofdigital assets, and general diligence necessary to betaken seriously, are broadly speaking becomingdefined. Regardless of your personal ideology andviews of the sector, this is a good thing.The irony of writing these paragraphs given theruling we’re discussing as the centre-point of thisessay is not lost on us; simultaneously the rulingitself sets a degree of clarity. It’s now clear thatany privacy preserving software, on-chain or not, isnow within scope for legal persecution on theEuropean continent. Risk models should be updatedaccordingly.Technical PrecedentIt is true that no smart contract deployed to ablockchain can be modified. Once deployed thecontract itself is immutable. That being said, it isin fact possible to change the behaviour of aprotocol through various technical mechanisms thatare outside the scope of this essay. just take ourword for it (lookup upgradable contracts if you’rereally that interested)It has been an open debate for some time as towhether this approach should be endorsed –particularly for certain types of protocols – as theright way forwards.The benefits are obvious: the ability to upgrade andimprove the behaviour of a protocol with what wouldbe a seamless experience for users. The contracts are“upgraded” (technical implementation notwithstanding)and the users benefit.If smart contracts can be “upgraded” to improve theprotocol, it stands to reason that they can bechanged to enact behaviour to the owners’ own benefitonly – a compromise of the protocol if you will. Theidea that protocols should be immutable on-chain -i.e. being able to be trustedabsolutely such that wecan read the code,in-perpetuity, in the knowledgethey cannot be changed - is compelling. Uniswap as aprotocol is a clear and established demonstration ofthis.The Uniswap PrecedentThere are now 4 versions of the Uniswap protocolavailable. Each one a wholly new deployment of smartcontracts with no association to the previous. Thiswas by design. The contracts could not be “upgraded”to automatically distribute these new features orideas to users. Each user of the protocol – bothsides of the transaction – had to select whichversion(s) of the protocol they wanted to use. Tothis day, there are many newly released tokens thatare distributed on older versions of Uniswap forvarious reasons.What this does mean however is that as time movesforwards, the trust we can place in the contracts toalways behave in that manner, and not have securityrisks increases. Indeed, if there was a critical flawin the protocol that a threat actor could exploit, italmost certainly would have by now.It also provides the creators of Uniswap with a verypowerful defence against the rising tide ofregulation and scrutiny. Uniswap have reasonableneutrality as simply creators of “lower level” partsof the system.It’s that “lower level” aspect that is quitecritical. Even the most technically literate andcrypto-native of readers of this essay have likelynever actually interacted with Uniswap directly atthe protocol level. They’ll have almost certainlyused the Uniswap UI – the officially endorsed productimplementation – to perform whatever action they weretrying to.Layer 8 Problems The OSI LayersThere is a model we use in computer science calledthe “OSI Model”; a dated, albeit effective tool forunderstanding how our interconnected digital worldworks, each “layer” in the model a different positionin the card stack of abstractions we use to connectsystems, one on top of another until we arrive atwhat you experience as the modern internet. xkdc: DependencyA better view of what this means in practice would bethe above – an evergreen xkcd comic – about thehandful of developers who (thanklessly) continue todevelop and support critical “low level” packages andlibraries we use in our daily lives.There’s that “low level” denomination again.If Alexey is guilty of writing code that“foreseeably” could be used by sanctioned entities,then so are the developers of the encryption,networking, and browser libraries we all – even moreso the government – use daily to protect our digitalactivities; from not just authoritarian inspection,but from the general malice that permeates the world.The courts would never come after developers ofanything lower down in the OSI stack; a model that wefeel that today, does no longer accuratelyencapsulate the evolved complexity and abstractionsthat come with blockchains. In any other“traditional” system, implementing the relevantcontrols and regulations at the top of the stack wasdeemed sufficient. We don’t feel that there is anysubstantial reason for this to change.The design and development of immutable, composableprotocols – financial or otherwise – specificallywhere they are to be used on decentralised,permissionless blockchains, is no different fromdeveloping any other “low level” protocol. Theseprotocols must be immutable for any credible level oftrust to be placed in them, and thus are impossibleto comply with evolving regulatory requirements.Assuming the same set of developers who would likelygo on to build a high-level, user facing applicationthat simply leverages this and potentially otherprotocols, go on to implement any and all pertinentregulatory requirements and controls, there is noreason to believe that these developers had anyintention of sanctions busting or non-compliance.CloseWe should be thankful that there will be a secondcourt case, that for Tornado Cash co-author RomanStorm, held in the US; due instead this time for ajury trial, and not a Dutch three-judge-court. Weshall be keeping a close eye on how that unfolds,what evidence the US prosecutor can actually bring tobear to prove the charges, and how the juryinterprets each position. It is our deep personalhope that sanity prevails, and that the US maintainsits foundational commitment to individual liberties,in a time when its democracy remains again tested.We live in truly unprecedented times; where the ideaof something that isn’t a person can be subject tosanctions, and that a person can be found guilty ofsomething that may or may not happen in the future.We champion and support anyone standing against thealarming rise of illiberalism wherever it can befound, and look forwards to a future where personaland financial freedom for everyone is attainable inany format, private, or otherwise.The Dutch court was of the opinion that it should have been‘foreseeable’ to the software developers when they were writingthe Tornado Cash open source code that, at some unspecified datein the future, money originating from crime could be deposited intothe smart contracts, taking advantage of the concealing effect ofthe tool. It was on this basis of “foreseeability” - that theseimmutable contracts might one day be used by a sanctioned entity to launder money - that Alexey was found guilty. The court viewed Tornado’s privacy protection function as afunction to conceal - which amounted to conspiracy to moneylaundering under Dutch law. By doing so, the judges assumed therewas no legitimate use case for privacy and treated the developersas responsible for the creation of a tool of potential misuse. None of these elements exist in the case of software developerswho create and deploy immutable smart contract protocols, andnone of them were proven in this case.Daniel MilesJun 13, 2024\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The birth of theinternet era has enabled literally anyone with aburning enough desire to solve problems at a scalepreviously thought impossible.That said building digital products and servicesisn\\'t a complete walk in the park, and the internetcan be a dangerous place if not treated with therespect it needs. The rise of cyber crime has led tomarket size of $7 Trillion by some estimates, largerthan some of the worlds biggest economies. We know that not everyone is a cyber security expert,we also know that a lot of the terms and language isincredibly nuanced and vague, even confusing theexperts themselves.Getting answers to questions such as am I doing thisright, what the hell is \"compliance\" and that alertlooks scary what should I do? is never as easy aswe\\'d like it to be.This is where Delphi comes in.The WhatDelphi builds on top of our work with other AImodels, specifically Large Language Models.Delphi itself is a fine-tuned LLM using a customdataset of cyber security information, alerts, andreporting that we\\'ve been compiling for several yearsnow.We\\'ve then built a very simple chat wrapper aroundthe produced model that you can ask questions to,very similar to how other conversational AIs work,but specifically designed to help you get answers andnext-step actions for cyber questions or problemsyou\\'re facing.Today, it\\'s just a simple chat conversation.

Powered by Ghost STRAININewAlchemy-DeFiTurnsMetalsLiquid Following on from our last post on Real World Assets(RWAs), its clear that liquidity is needed to bringmany such projects to fruition. DeFi, with its easeof transaction and confidence in code, is an idealcandidate to bring grand vision of RWAs to life. Thisarticle lays out the bird's eye view of how thismight begin to mechanically work.Stratified CostsMany RWA projects face internally stratified costs.In the case of commodity or precious metals; it canbe more difficult to bring one component part of thesame combined asset to fruition; ground gets hotterand ores get denser the deeper one digs. One canstraightforwardly imagine a way to arbitrage excessdemand into supply of such a component, the same wayany crowdfunder goes to market and says: But scaling this model, especially under CeFi, haslimited flexibility. Transaction fees are sickening,high value transactions have to be individuallyapproved by law, conversion into more advantageouscurrencies wherever you are is expensive; everythingworks worse, but is entrenched and so is defaultedto. Moreover, CeFi, by its declaration and disclosurerequirements, promotes the sorts of perverseincentives which set up oligopolies in exactly thesort of new markets we want to be competitive. How?Well, remember those higher costs? Those are alreadyraising barriers to entry, and, more importantly,promoting strong selection biases for those who canget past them to economise at scale. Combine thiswith the knowledge that you can only get as far asone disclosed jurisdiction plus its connectionsbefore competitors jump on you, and it doesn't makesense to run the completely honest go to market whichthese economic models are fundamentally predicatedon, especially if I've reached the point where Idon't need to do this. Too big to fail, too grandiosefor candour. It instead makes sense to channel yourinner Julius II, and Treaty of Tordesillas yourselfand any competitors into strictly defined zones wherethere's less competition and the consumer ultimatelyloses.DeFi can fix this both for the ambitious producerand, by extension, consumers, even if they nevernotice it. I'd almost go as far as to say theconsumer not needing to focus on their financialsystem is a compliment.Tokens As RightsImagine that some variation of the Green New Deal,mandatory ESG, so on so forth, actually becomes law.I own a Lithium mine, and demand goes stratosphericbecause now all those additional batteries which haveto go in those electric cars need my commodity towork profitably. However, as above, parts of mydeposit previously didn't make sense to exploit, and,even with this newfound sovereign backed demand, somesmaller part still doesn't. We now have three tiersof stratified product going to the same ends. CeFidoesn't allow for easy arbitration on this, nevermind elegant expression of how that cost is going tovary.Now, imagine that I issue a token instead, which,upon certain requirements being met, entitles theholder to the produce, or profit equivalent of, thismine, corresponding to the volume of tokens theyhold. The advantages for me are obvious; I'm notlocked into long term instruments, I can market forliquidity much more widely, and I'm not subject toCeFi mission creep. I can also market all of thesethings as points to investors and consumers alike.On top of that, I can treat the different strata ofmy product with bespoke tokens, or change the releaseorder to simulate that difference, or do any one of ahundred other things. Importantly, I have animmediately flexible way to respond to demand,because demand can now be more directly signalled. Ifthe globe gets hotter than expected and regulationstighten further, I can open up operations into thatthird strata with code in seconds, whereas a paralleloperation in CeFi would involve vis maior clauses inthe innumerable contracts I've signed, which go toany number of arbitrators, so on and so forth. Muchmore costly for everyone involved; far moredistorting on the actual price consumers end uppaying, especially where demand inelastic goods areconcerned.Less obvious, and far more powerful, are theadditional benefits to investors. Like me, theyaren't locked into long term financial contracts.They can trust the code, rather than eleven differentbankers and all their incentives. There's now, justas in any other DeFi space, a market on those tokens.You don't have to care about Lithium to get involvedin my venture now - you can directly speculatestrictly on the financial returns without any CeFirestrictions getting in the way.This then allows all manner of interested andspecialist parties to get involved in their own way;yield farming, options, ETF's; we can directly plughigh fixed costs projects into the liquidity marketsthey need to get prices down and wealth in real termsup. Human deception and error can be eliminatedbecause, code is the law here. Tying back to theabove, the lack of disclosure requirements reduceswhat my competitors know about my capabilities andambitions. It's now decision theory, rather thangeneral game theory. They're forced back intobehaving like exactly that, competitors; I'm forcedinto actually carving out what I want based onproduct quality and customer service, rather thancornering the supply ahead of time and maximising formy own surplus.I can feel Hayek smiling from here.Come One, Come AllAll of the above is true in the case of one commoditywith a specific range of use cases and a variablecost. However, mines aren't pure. Going back to myexample, Magnesium is often found alongside Lithium.Like Lithium, Magnesium has a range of commercial usecases. If its lightweight and electric, or needs tomaintain internal stability at high speed, itprobably has Magnesium in it, but notice that theseuse cases are subtly different from Lithium. Havingenjoyed my runaway success tokenising Lithium, andnoticing the low XED in my products, I want totokenise Magnesium too.And now comes the cherry on top; liquidity pools.DeFi, can, by setting up a pool of tokensrepresenting my Lithium supply compared againsttokens representing my Magnesium supply, do more thaneliminate extortionate CeFi currency arbitrage. This rests on some assumptions, but not necessarilythe ones you'd intuit. My ownership of the mine atthis stage doesn't matter very much - once the tokensare out in the world for exchange, as long as themine keeps mining, who owns it matters very little.The core assumption is that whatever rate of supplyall this overlay infrastructure was posed on remainsinside tolerance limits. This is, as with every otherfinancial instrument, more true as you rack up risk.The heavier I bet on Lithium against Magnesium, orvice versa, if supply of one stops, I'm in trouble.But there's no reason for this risk to becomeexistential to the given DeFi system; much less sothan in CeFi because, again, code is law. There's noincentive for larger agents to conspire to push theleverage beyond what's sane, knowing that thetaxpayer will backstop them - there's no taxpayerhere.This also allows consortiums of smaller retailinvestors access to profits reserved forinstitutional actors under CeFi. Say a well-performing retail investor gets news of incomingregulation; my Magnesium extraction operation goes sowell that I've flooded some electronics manufacturingmarket somewhere, and the price is going to fallimminently, causing some other tokenised and pooledasset to rise in response (which need not be Lithiumat this point). Well, they can take out a flash loanand arbitrage on the price hike on the othercommodity - easy profit, directly to consumers.C.F. Fiat StablesComparing against fiat stables provides furtherelucidation. Counterparty risk is (largely)ameliorated by using a commmodity - as long as thereis liquid demand for the underlying commodity andconfidence in the token, there'll be someone lookingto purchase. This is not the case where underlyingfiat positions are being abandoned or rolled back.Some others would have been in the worse position offactoring their structural inequalities into theirdistribution, but MiCA more or less kills anypossibility of a competitive European stable.A niche, but perhaps, dare I say, dull market in theunderlying commodity is advisable; those in broaderdemand or with more dangerous applications are likelyto have their movements around the globe regulatedand tracked - all complications project directly ontoany pegged token. This must in turn be reconciledwith logistical constraints and liquidity concerns -the backer can be as confident as they like, but thestable is still limited by the total market of theunderlying commodity. Perhaps some fractionation isin order - it's difficult for me to ship rare earthmetals around the globe on a whim, but if Iincorporate them into a larger order of more commondeliverables, average prices start dropping.Similarly, if my token (and, chemistry allowing,physical currency to match) is based on a rarercommodity to the extent that a price is readilyderivable, I can, up to my established risk appetite,build that into something more commonplace to easeliquidity concerns, and effectively optioniseliquidity.I mention physical coinage representing a token asanother approach to liquidity problems, especiallyones related to friction and uptake. If it becomesjust the next kind of cash, the average person canuse what is also a stable and a token from theirphysical wallet, as well as a chain one. All that isnecessary is drumming up the underlying capital tomatch the token with parallel coinage, and convincingwhichever central banks one intends to target thatintroducing this parallel coinage won't havedisastrous effects. An awful lot certainly, but, avisible amount. This is perhaps the most heterodoxambition in this paper, but in a deglobalising world,I remain hopeful. Those who choose to break from thedollar over pride, prerogative or prudence could finda cooler political alternative in a decentralised,private option, set apart from centralisedgeopolitical intrigue and diorama. Especially injurisdictions where cash substitution is a longrunning issue - none of the political friction ofCBDC's (nor expenses incurred in building thenecessary infrastructure on the public purse), easyintegration into all extant markets, and directtracking, assuming some mechanism to correspond ahybrid coin to its token (the most difficult part tobuild into a technology which would try to solve boththese problems at once, but necessary lest doublespending take hold everywhere). An ATM likedispensary connected to a wallet might be a goodstart.But, drawing our metaphor to a close: if I don't likehow separate my Lithium and Magnesium markets are,even if I can address them separately, and tokenisethose efforts, how about I fuse the two with a tokenmade of 50% Lithium, 50% Magnesium? Ok, don't put itin water, or heated air, or pure oxygen... but youget the point. Liquidity (or reactivity) concerns?Just dilute into a different ratio with a parallelrefining product and resume the process.Especially if favoured counterparties could be madeready, waiting to provide liquidity across thebarrier until it dissolves, and then translatecustomers into the new paradigm once I decide to makerid of it. Instant market-wide efficiencyimprovements, and wider uptake appeal.I'd have triangulated demand between, and therebyprofit maximised the supply of, my individualproducts, derivatives thereof, and fusionstherebetween, in one fell swoop. Oh, yeah, andcreated a parallel financial ecosystem, limited onlyby scale and adoption.Aut Caesar, Aut Nihil.Concluding NecessitiesIt's not obvious where such a system should be basedor begin from. Stables would make a good place tostart, and neither the EU nor US is a good home forthem right now; this will be further commented onlater.Further, as you've likely surmised, it's likely tomake CeFi, and all its institutional power, very,very angry, long before DeFi figures out itsadvertising and comprehensibility problems. In anuncertain, de-globalising world, only relativelyinsulated and uninvested jurisdictions make obvioushomes, and the US isn't a good place to start as longas the SEC maintains its current course. Mexico,Canada and Australia might all be strong candidateswith commodities connections and some kind of shockinsulation from changes in trading markets.However, for the ambitious, I can think of no bettertriple offensive to legitimate DeFi, establish alegacy which spans the transition from CeFi intoDeFi, and which garners prestige to last generations.All remaining notes concern judicious deployment; farbetter handled by operatives than ideates.'Hey, please give me money for x, you'll get y in response [ahead oftime]' even if y is just feeling charitable.

Thispassage from a soon to be released white-paper weauthored for a client explains; Natural TranslatorsLLMs are exceptionally good at getting from one formof language to another, be it from one interpretationof a text to another, between whole other languages,or where some of the most important advances arebeing made, getting from language that peopleunderstand, to one that machines do.The process of getting from what users want to do insoftware to the machines actually doing it has beenone of the most important and studied fields inmodern software engineering. It drives everythingfrom the foundational APIs and primitives we buildupon, to the user interfaces and design choices thatare made. LLMs in this regard, are the translators we\\'ve alwaysbeen looking for to help get us from the language ofexpressiveness and nuance that we humans use everyday, to the language of rules that is necessary forcomputers to function.There’s no clearer example of this than GithubCopilot, a product designed to support engineers inwriting code — the language of rules that machinesare governed by — from simple human readablecomments. A very simplistic demonstration of Copilot in actionPrompt MachinesThe use of LLMs is not however, just limited totranslation. These models similarly fall under the\"generative AI\" banner for a reason; when given alimited input, prompt, or question, you can leveragethem to generate or complete the content or answerfor you. This enables them to fill interesting rolesin the search and chat functions.There\\'s a common misconception around models such asthese that they\\'re sat atop some massive database ofall known knowledge to answer questions, much in thesame way a normal search engine is. This isn\\'t quiteaccurate (albeit yes the new Bing and Bard productsto leverage AI with their traditional search enginedatabases). These models are trained on massivedatasets that allow them to predict the answer – withincredible accuracy – to your question.Sibylline was named after the Sibylline books,ancient books purchased from a Sibyl by the last kingof Rome, and consulted upon during times of greatcrisis. The word Sibyl is derived from the ancientgreek sibylla or prohpetess; those who would giveanswers towards those who provide good questions.LLMs operate on a similar premise. The responses thatthese models create are formed from not just theinput question that you provide, but also from thesurrounding context, additional input information,and \"prompting\". All of these collectively go in todraw the attention of the model to the next correcttoken, leading to the most accurate answer. Or as Stephen Wolfram succinctly put it...its overall goal is to continue text in a “reasonable” way, based onwhat it’s seen from the training it’s had (which consists in lookingat billions of pages of text from the web, etc.) So at any givenpoint, it’s got a certain amount of text—and its goal is to come upwith an appropriate choice for the next token to add.ClosingThe AI industry is advancing at a rapid pace, withinnovations being unveiled so quickly it seems wemight need our own platform to keep pace—an ideaproposed internally and echoed by our clients.As mentioned, this is the first in a series of postsabout our work and experiments in the AI domain andhow we guide clients in harnessing its potential.Throughout this series, we\\'ll delve into:Our strategy for identifying and validatingeffective AI use-cases and deployments to addressreal client problems, and avoiding hype-driveninvestmentsTechnical breakdowns of how we build and deploycost-effective LLM solutions for our internal toolsand projectsStories from our journeys with clients,highlighting the process of unlocking the power ofAI for their businessesLook forwards to having you follow us for the ride!Natural LanguageNatural language refers to the ways humans communicate usingeither spoken or written words and naturally arises in humansocieties as a means of communication. Most of the languages wespeak on this planet fall under the umbrella of “natural language”.Natural language is both complex and flexible, and allows ushumans to express a wide range of ideas, emotions, and concepts,but it’s also innately ambiguous. It’s this ambiguity that computersstruggle to understand, and where the field of natural languageprocessing comes in. There are no fixed rules in natural language,and even if there were, a significant portion of the speakingpopulation would not follow them; this is the origin of slang andlocal dialects.Natural language processing instead turned to the world ofstatistics to glean insight into language and how to make itmachine usable, with the most recent breakthrough in this fieldcoming in the form of “Large Language Models”Large Language ModelLarge Language Models (LLMs) are a form of artificial intelligencebuilt on top of deep learning architectures, initially such as NeuralNetworks, but more recently leveraging what are called“Transformer” models, an approach initially pioneered by GoogleLLMs were popularised by OpenAI with their release of the ChatGPTproduct; a simple interface for conversing with their latest GPT3.5LLM model. This model surpassed all models at the time at the testsavailable, and captured the imagination of the world as itdemonstrated the real power of LLMs in action, producing someincredible works of writing, code, and insight with what seemed liketrivial effortIn practice, this model was simply the industrial application ofnatural language processing. The contextual meaning of sentencesbeing passed to it, and the expected reply to them, was understoodand created through the intensive statistical analysis of a massivedataset on machine learning models with billions of parameters.Daniel MilesJul 10, 2023 Subscribe', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If youhaven’t already, I thoroughly recommend the “WalletCentric Customer Experience Stack” by Ben Basche.Recent conversations with him have only reinforced myviews here.IdentitiesWhat is a wallet? At a base technical level it can beas simple as a public/private key pair, or as complexas an on-chain smart contract. At a philosophicallevel however?It’s a key to your digital identity. An identity youneed to do anything online.Digital identity is something that we’ve beenexploring for decades now, even long before the firstsmart contracts were written. It’s come in manyshapes and forms; from the humble username andpassword, to the behemoth that is OAuth.Cyber security professionals have wrestled withidentity since cyber was a thing, modelling the bestway to place who someone is, and what they can do,with some models being more successful than others.These models were all incomplete.It turns out that your digital identity and yourfinancial identity are in fact inextricably linked.We have built billions of dollars of products andinfrastructure around this key fact. Paypal, Stripe,Apple Pay; all products that attempt to wrangle these2 separate identities into something a little lesspainful to manage.Consider the customer experience of almost all sitesthese days. You’ll likely login with Google orFacebook, proceed to find the thing that you want, beit a service or a product, and then go to some kindof checkout flow. This checkout flow will allow youto select from one of the integrated paymentssolutions, be it something more seamless such asApple Pay — which has gone to great lengths toattempt to merge these 2 identities — or moretraditionally built solutions such as Stripecheckout. Removing from the equation the heavilyconvoluted settlement layer that is our traditionalfinancial infrastructure, it’s pretty clear thatreally the most desirable experience here is onewhere all of these payment methods come with yourdigital identity;Or that your financial identity was in fact what you used onlineinsteadI’d posit that if “Login with your bank” was anoption because they pioneered OAuth alongside Google, it would have been incredibly popular. You’dalready be KYC-ed if that was necessary, paymentswould “just work” and would be secured using the sameteams that keep your money safe in the bank.ExperiencesOutside of revolutionary changes in Human InterfaceDevices such as the newly released Apple Vision Pro,the base experience apps should have is a prettysolved problem.Pull down to refresh. Swipe to go back. Single clicklogin gets you to the start of the value chain.It\\'s been made abundantly clear that the seed-phrasebased approach to wallets thus far is completelyunfit for purpose in that regard. Users don\\'t want tohave to manage their seed phrases, no more than theywant to manage their own email server.The Wallet Centric experience starts here, with acreation and “login\" (read: connect) flow that looksand feels almost identical to the login flows we havetoday, getting users to the key value of your productquickly and with low friction.This isn’t a particularly out-there realisation.Several of the biggest names in the space — Uniswapnotably among them — have decided that the “embeddedwallet” native within their mobile app experience isthe way forwards. These approaches work for getting alarger wedge of market-share by capturing those whochurn due to entry costs; good for their short-termusage numbers, but eliminates key parts of the valueof a true wallet-centric experience. The contents of my wallet should allow my experienceto be tailored. This can’t be done when itsfragmented across multiple wallets where I would haveto export the private key to move it around.Ramps and RailsHalfway through writing this piece someone sent meSimon Taylors Future of Payments blog; in there beinga particularly pertinent comment; Crypto can act as payment rails, a point Simon alsocalls out, but independently it can act as acustodian. If I want to access DeFi pools with aboveaverage returns or escape my countries currencyvolatility and hedge it by simply holding stables, Iwant to have a combined digital and financialidentity that can allow me to do this.My previous Letter to DeFi talks about how the futureof DeFi will look a lot more like a modern Neobankthan it does what we have today. There I also touchbriefly about how if you were to build one around aWallet Centric experience, you could create somethingseriously compelling, and indeed there are someplayers barking at this thesis.Behind this experience you can then begin to abstractaway the ever increasing number of payment rails thatare being created — and the crypto ramps that want toservice them — reaping the benefits that these teamsare creating in attempting to create smooth fiatrails for customers as you float between the 2systems.A value proposition that can now be brought to allapps; a single contact point for developers to buildfrom and a single identity for users, fiat and cryptobuilt in.As a passing comment I suspect this is Coinbase’s tolose. They have an exceptionally strong position inbeing one of the biggest on-ramps into crypto at themoment — one that’s also attempting to do it properlyno less — and are actively pursuing a “Wallet as aService” strategy. I highly suspect that the naturalevolution of centralised exchanges will converge tobanking which leaves Coinbase; then a bank with adigital wallet identity and deep token liquidity,sitting in an incredibly strong position. I digress,an essay for another time.The LoopThe future of crypto/”web3”/whatever will have usersenter because they arrived at an app they wanted touse, ”logged in” and proceeded to have an identitycreated for them.Where this has been done through a wallet-centricapproach, it’ll be this same identity they have whenthey arrive at the next app they want to use. Thecold-start problem here is ensuring that apps want tobuild from a particular wallet because they solvegenuine user challenges such as rails, gas, or chaincomplexity.The loop arrives when apps want to build out fromthis wallet because they understand that this wherethe users already are.Merchants accept specific payment methods becausethey want to attract and capture the users that arefound within those systems. The future of digitalidentities will have apps building around theidentity instead, knowing that with it comes thefinancial identity with the relevant rails becausethey’re now one and the same.It’s here that once the base experiences have beensolved, that the “identity providers” will begin todifferentiate.Providers can open up more APIs to developers totailor their experiences further, be it from newloyalty offers, to financing options or even cross-chain. Alternatively the experience might be morestraight-jacketed, ensuring that the experienceacross apps is always reproducible and understood,attracting a host of users who churn at too muchchoice and want to simply access a very simple andrefined digital experience. Winners here will, asever, be the ones that can identify what users andbuilders want and iterate to get the right productmarket fit the quickest.Whichever provider masters the “personas” challenge,allowing me to have uniquely tailored experiencesdepending on a certain identity I currently want touse, but without having to “login” to entirely newsystems and break out of flow, stands a strong chanceof creating a very defensible base offering.ClosingOur current digital identities are badly overdue anoverhaul, but simple changes over the “Login” floware insufficient to realise the true potential here.How digital identities should feel is a solvedconsumer problem. No-one but the maxi’s insisted onhaving to manage your own private keys, and theirtime is short lived.How financial identities should behave is a solvedconsumer problem, with minor iterations enabling newexperiences in certain spaces but build onfundamentally the wrong primitives.The convergence of these 2 identities will enable allusers to project themselves digitally in the way thatthey’re supposed to, not missing out on certainexperiences just because they made the wrong consumerchoice of what card issuer they went with.Fundamentally however, we were a wallet startup. I don’t have multiple identities across multiple apps where each apphas created a key-pair for me.I have one identity (perhaps with N personas, more on that later)which I want to project into all of my digital experiences. India, the home of UPI and digital identity, doesn\\'t yet have an openbanking standard, which suggests identity is the proper foundationof payments if you were to start again.
